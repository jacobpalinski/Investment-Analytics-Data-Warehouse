        "title":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall",
        "description":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall India's central bank shocked markets this morning when it slashing interest rates (in a 5:1 vote) by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row - and the largest rate cut since the covid crash, amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy. It also spiked the amount of liquidity available in the system to kickstart moribund lending. The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years, following two previous 25bps reductions in April and February.Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is \"lower than our aspirations\" and the bank felt it was \"imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment\" amid rising global uncertainties.Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The world's (newly) most populous country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices.RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. Inflation for Fiscal Year 2026 has been revised down to 3.7% from 4%, with Q1 (April- June) projected at just 2.9%. Growth forecast remains unchanged at 6.5%. This growth is well below the 8% growth the RBI aspires for.There was another big surprise in today's announcement: alongside the greater than expected cut, the central bank changed its monetary policy stance from \"accommodative\" to \"neutral\", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves, a move which was viewed as hawkish, and sparking a sharp curve steepening. The change in stance suggests the bar for further rate cuts is now higher. As the RBI noted, after 100bps of cuts since February, policy space is now limited.However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low.The RBI also unexpectedly cut the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) rate starting September 2025 , which is set to release INR2.5tn into the banking system. With liquidity already in surplus, overnight rates may now move closer to the SDF, 25bps below the repo rate.Credit growth remains weak at 9.8% YoY (vs 19.5% a year ago). The CRR cut, to be implemented in four 25bps tranches starting September, aims to improve credit transmission. The Governor noted that announcing the schedule in advance is meant to reassure banks of the RBI\u2019s commitment to supporting liquiditySome more details from Goldman Sachs:Policy rate - lowered by 50bp with a 5:1 vote: The RBI MPC voted 5:1 to lower the policy repo rate by 50bp to 5.50% at the June meeting, vs. an expectation of a 25bp repo rate cut. External Member Bhattacharya voted for a 25bp repo rate cut. Consequently, both the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate were lowered by 50bp each to 5.75% and 5.25%, respectively.Policy stance changed to 'neutral': The MPC changed its policy stance back to 'neutral' from 'accommodative'. The Governor clarified that \"after having reduced the policy repo rate by 100 bps in quick succession since February 2025, under the current circumstances, monetary policy is left with very limited space to support growth\". We interpret this as the end of the current rate easing cycle with repo rate at 5.50% -- implying ~1% real policy rate on a one-year forward inflation forecast. The RBI may not want the ex-ante real rate below 1%, in our view, especially when the growth outlook is balanced. We had been forecasting a 5.50% repo rate marking the end of the cycle, with 25bp rate cuts each in June and August meetings, but the RBI got there a meeting faster than we expected.Growth forecast retained at 6.5% yoy for FY26: The RBI retained their growth forecast at 6.5% yoy for FY26 (GSe: 6.2% yoy), noting strong agricultural sector growth and rural demand, and a resilient services sector underpinning a recovery in urban demand. However, the Governor highlighted downside risks to growth from US \"reciprocal\" tariff-related uncertainty and prolonged geopolitical tensions.Inflation forecast lowered by 30bp to 3.7% yoy for FY26: The RBI lowered its inflation forecast by 30bp to 3.7% yoy (GSe: 3.6% yoy) (Exhibit 1). The Governor highlighted that there is \u201cgreater confidence of headline inflation remaining below the target of 4% over the course of the year\u201d. Food inflation is likely to remain benign given higher wheat and pulses (legumes) production. Additionally, Indian Meteorological Department\u2019s expectations of an above-normal monsoon bode well for the production of summer crops. However, the Governor also highlighted upside risks to the inflation outlook from weather and US \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff-related uncertainty.Banking system liquidity: The RBI announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 100bp to 3.0% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in four tranches from September to November to ease banking system liquidity further. As per the RBI\u2019s estimate, this measure is expected to release durable liquidity of INR 2.5tn (0.7% of GDP) into the banking system.The Governor said that the RBI \u201cremains committed to provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system\". With durable liquidity already in surplus in recent months, overnight rates have traded on an average ~20bp below the repo rate from April to June (Exhibit 2), resulting in a significant easing in financial conditions. As a result, overnight rates have come off by more than 150bp from mid-January to now.India's lower borrowing costs will have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector.\"This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,\" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.Predictably, Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement. Looking ahead, Goldman expects the RBI to stay on hold for the rest of the year unless growth slows sharply. The front end of the IGB curve should remain supported by strong liquidity and favorable demand-supply dynamics. The bank favors 2Y IGB and expect the IGB curve to steepen.

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

        "title":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall",
        "description":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall India's central bank shocked markets this morning when it slashing interest rates (in a 5:1 vote) by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row - and the largest rate cut since the covid crash, amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy. It also spiked the amount of liquidity available in the system to kickstart moribund lending. The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years, following two previous 25bps reductions in April and February.Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is \"lower than our aspirations\" and the bank felt it was \"imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment\" amid rising global uncertainties.Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The world's (newly) most populous country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices.RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. Inflation for Fiscal Year 2026 has been revised down to 3.7% from 4%, with Q1 (April- June) projected at just 2.9%. Growth forecast remains unchanged at 6.5%. This growth is well below the 8% growth the RBI aspires for.There was another big surprise in today's announcement: alongside the greater than expected cut, the central bank changed its monetary policy stance from \"accommodative\" to \"neutral\", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves, a move which was viewed as hawkish, and sparking a sharp curve steepening. The change in stance suggests the bar for further rate cuts is now higher. As the RBI noted, after 100bps of cuts since February, policy space is now limited.However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low.The RBI also unexpectedly cut the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) rate starting September 2025 , which is set to release INR2.5tn into the banking system. With liquidity already in surplus, overnight rates may now move closer to the SDF, 25bps below the repo rate.Credit growth remains weak at 9.8% YoY (vs 19.5% a year ago). The CRR cut, to be implemented in four 25bps tranches starting September, aims to improve credit transmission. The Governor noted that announcing the schedule in advance is meant to reassure banks of the RBI\u2019s commitment to supporting liquiditySome more details from Goldman Sachs:Policy rate - lowered by 50bp with a 5:1 vote: The RBI MPC voted 5:1 to lower the policy repo rate by 50bp to 5.50% at the June meeting, vs. an expectation of a 25bp repo rate cut. External Member Bhattacharya voted for a 25bp repo rate cut. Consequently, both the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate were lowered by 50bp each to 5.75% and 5.25%, respectively.Policy stance changed to 'neutral': The MPC changed its policy stance back to 'neutral' from 'accommodative'. The Governor clarified that \"after having reduced the policy repo rate by 100 bps in quick succession since February 2025, under the current circumstances, monetary policy is left with very limited space to support growth\". We interpret this as the end of the current rate easing cycle with repo rate at 5.50% -- implying ~1% real policy rate on a one-year forward inflation forecast. The RBI may not want the ex-ante real rate below 1%, in our view, especially when the growth outlook is balanced. We had been forecasting a 5.50% repo rate marking the end of the cycle, with 25bp rate cuts each in June and August meetings, but the RBI got there a meeting faster than we expected.Growth forecast retained at 6.5% yoy for FY26: The RBI retained their growth forecast at 6.5% yoy for FY26 (GSe: 6.2% yoy), noting strong agricultural sector growth and rural demand, and a resilient services sector underpinning a recovery in urban demand. However, the Governor highlighted downside risks to growth from US \"reciprocal\" tariff-related uncertainty and prolonged geopolitical tensions.Inflation forecast lowered by 30bp to 3.7% yoy for FY26: The RBI lowered its inflation forecast by 30bp to 3.7% yoy (GSe: 3.6% yoy) (Exhibit 1). The Governor highlighted that there is \u201cgreater confidence of headline inflation remaining below the target of 4% over the course of the year\u201d. Food inflation is likely to remain benign given higher wheat and pulses (legumes) production. Additionally, Indian Meteorological Department\u2019s expectations of an above-normal monsoon bode well for the production of summer crops. However, the Governor also highlighted upside risks to the inflation outlook from weather and US \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff-related uncertainty.Banking system liquidity: The RBI announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 100bp to 3.0% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in four tranches from September to November to ease banking system liquidity further. As per the RBI\u2019s estimate, this measure is expected to release durable liquidity of INR 2.5tn (0.7% of GDP) into the banking system.The Governor said that the RBI \u201cremains committed to provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system\". With durable liquidity already in surplus in recent months, overnight rates have traded on an average ~20bp below the repo rate from April to June (Exhibit 2), resulting in a significant easing in financial conditions. As a result, overnight rates have come off by more than 150bp from mid-January to now.India's lower borrowing costs will have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector.\"This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,\" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.Predictably, Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement. Looking ahead, Goldman expects the RBI to stay on hold for the rest of the year unless growth slows sharply. The front end of the IGB curve should remain supported by strong liquidity and favorable demand-supply dynamics. The bank favors 2Y IGB and expect the IGB curve to steepen.

        "title":"Highs And Lows",
        "description":"Highs And Lows By Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at RabobankHighs and LowsBond yields were up some 5 basis points globally whilst the euro made a slight reversal after having pushed for a near high of 1.15 as the ECB concluded its press conference. From a \u2018low\u2019 inspired by 50% tariffs on US steel and aluminium imports going \u2018live\u2019 earlier this week and growing concerns about the US economy and the labor market, sentiment in financial markets briefly swung back to a \u2018high\u2019 as President Donald Trump said he had a \u201cvery good phone call\u201d with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Gains in equity markets were modest but still good enough for S&P500 to extend its rally to 20% from its 8 April low. That is, before the falling-out between Trump and Musk reached a boiling point on social media. Enough is being written about that right now, so we\u2019ll leave you at it.After the call with Xi, Trump said that both leaders have agreed to further talks and that there \u201cshould no longer be any questions respectively the complexity of Rare Earth products\u201d. That\u2019s up for various interpretations, but it suggests China has offered to speed up its process of lifting its export restrictions. Still, the Chinese readout of the call, unsurprisingly, was more nuanced and said that Xi had urged Trump to remove \u201cnegative\u201d measures that have affected trade between the countries in recent months. The upshot, from the market\u2019s perspective is that both sides are, at least, talking and that holds the prospect of further progress in removing some (still very high) tariffs. But, just for balance, Commerce Secretary Lutnick yesterday called for increased enforcement of US export controls on technology, warning that China was \u201conly attacking great American companies.\u201d If President Xi was referring to those export controls with \u201cnegative measures\u201d, the market\u2019s positive assessment may be, well, too high.That further talks with the US can lead to a \u2018deal\u2019 (as Keir Starmer can confirm), a stalemate (see EU-US) or a major escalation, as Zelensky can attest, is on any global leader\u2019s mind. Nikkei Asia reports that US negotiators Bessent, Lutnick and Greer keep Japan guessing. \u201cAt one point the three cabinet officials put the talks with the Japanese side on hold an began debating right in front of them\u201d, a source tells the Nikkei. In that sense, German Chancellor Merz came away nicely after a 40-minute meeting in the Oval Office, as he let Trump do most of the talking. Little concrete came from that meeting, though Trump acknowledged the ramp-up in German defense spending.Trade data are going from lows to highs as well, which in some cases makes the Covid-episode data look pale. As the Commerce Department confirmed, the US trade deficit for April shrunk by the most on record, to $61.6bn from $138.3bn in March, driven by the largest-ever decline in imports.Frontloading in the run-up the tariffs clearly was massive and then collapsed. This also suggests that after its big negative contribution to US GDP growth in Q1 it will be a significant positive factor in Q2. Inventory effects will likely attenuate some of its effect. Bloomberg noted that a drop in imports of pharmaceuticals from Ireland was responsible for an almost $20bn swing in the deficit. The opposite (statistical) effect is thus going to be seen in Europe in Q2. Ireland yesterday reported a significant upward revision in Q1 GDP (which now points to a revision in Eurozone GDP growth to around +0.6% q\/q (!) from 0.3% previously). But this will obviously turn to a significant drag in Q2 as those US trade numbers for April just signaled.Staying in Europe, the ECB seemingly presented itself as an anchor of stability in these times of highs and lows. Lagarde\u2019s new mantra is now \u201cwell positioned\u201d, which could be viewed in our opinion as code language for \u201cwe\u2019re done cutting, unless...\u201d. This becomes even clearer when you compare it to the previous mantra Lagarde introduced in March when she called ECB policy \u201cmeaningfully less restrictive\u201d. We had expected little to no guidance from yesterday\u2019s policy meeting, but these new words \u2013 despite lower oil prices and a stronger euro \u2013 lead us to maintain our view that we have reached the terminal rate.However, the ECB leaves ample room to respond if things do not work out the way they envisage. Indeed, it lowered its inflation forecast significantly with core inflation positioned around 2% for the coming years. Moreover, its new scenario analyses unveiled a dovish reaction function to a potential escalation of trade tensions. Should this happen, and paused tariffs were to be reinstated, the ECB\u2019s economists estimate that this could lower GDP growth through 2027 by about 1% cumulatively. And, interestingly, they conclude that inflation would be somewhat lower as well: in such a scenario inflation would average 1.8% in 2027, and that includes the assumption that the EU retaliates. By contrast, our own econometric analysis indicates that European tariffs on the US would be (mildly) inflationary instead.Lagarde did say that their modelling exercise assumed that higher tariffs could lead to lower demand for euro area exports and to countries with overcapacity rerouting their exports to the euro area thereby putting more downward pressure on inflation. However, she acknowledged that the ECB\u2019s analysis did not include any inflationary impact from a disruption of supply chains. Although this effect, admittedly, is surrounded by even more uncertainty, we did take this into account in our own scenario analysis (which explains why we still have inflation somewhat above the ECB\u2019s target even in 2026). And one only need to take a quick glance at container freight rates (benchmark composite by WCI up by a staggering 175% compared to last month) to understand why be believe the ECB the ECB could be under-estimating the potential highs.Time will tell, of course. But one thing that the ECB may be right about, is the (initial) downward pressure on imported goods prices due to a diversion of trade. The European Commission yesterday published its first assessment from its trade diversion monitoring tool that was launched in April. The early warning system tracks shipments and prices of goods at a high level of detail. In the short-run lower prices may benefit European importers and thereby consumers, but if those prices are the result of overcapacity in other parts of the world (such as China) this could also undermine European producers. The South China Morning Post reported that \u201cin the month to May 25, imports of light-emitting diodes surged 156 per cent, while their price fell 65 per cent. Shipments of industrial robots shot up by 315 per cent, paired with a 35 per cent price decline. And imports of some bars and rods made from steel alloy soared by over 1,000 per cent as their price plunged 86 per cent.\u201dWhilst such figures can be extremely volatile due to their level of detail, seasonal patterns etc. and make no distinction between the origin of the content, a heatmap by the Commission shows that China was a significant contributor to these changes. The FT writes that the surge in steel imports, driven by trade diversion, is setting off alarm bells in the steel sector. Forecasting the next steps by the European Commission is a rather speculative affair, but we\u2019d not be surprised if this leads to some form of action. This year the Commission has already launched more than 10 cases against China and\/or Chinese producers (based on our count of news articles on the EU\u2019s trade defense website).

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%. European equities are little changed as investors search for fresh catalysts on trade negotiations between the US and China and look ahead to a key US jobs report.

WSJWe estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 110k in May, below consensus of 125k and the three-month average of +155k. On the positive side, big data indicators suggested a healthy pace of job creation. On the negative side, trade policy uncertainty was very high across the survey period and we expect another 10k decline in federal government payrolls from workforce reductions.

ASX 200 saw two-way, rangebound trade as outperformance in the energy and utilities sectors was counterbalanced by losses in gold miners and the top-weighted financial industry, while a lack of pertinent data releases also contributed to the uneventful picture.

Attention now is firmly fixated on today's NFP report which is set to see payroll growth slow to 130k from 177k and unemployment rate hold steady @ 4.2%. As it stands, the next 25bps cut is not fully priced until September with 54bps of loosening seen by year-end. DXY is towards the top end of yesterday's 98.35-98.94 range.EUR - EUR is trivially softer vs. the USD after gaining yesterday on account of the ECB rate decision which saw policymakers pull the trigger on a 25bps rate cut, whilst noting that policy is \"well-positioned\"; suggesting that the ECB could be nearing or at the end of its cutting cycle. ECB speak this morning hasn't shifted the dial with policymakers signalling flexibility going forward, whilst acknowledging progress on inflation.

The 10yr yield currently sits just above the 4.6% mark and within yesterday's 4.557-4.648% range.CommoditiesCrude Futures - Subdued trade amid a firmer Dollar and overall cautious risk tone heading into the US jobs report before the weekend. Contracts saw a leg lower likely on technicals as WTI dipped under USD 63.00\/bbl at the same time as Brent fell under USD 65.00\/bbl, although prices thereafter stabilised. News flow has been light for the complex, with nothing major to report in geopolitics either.Precious Metals - Spot gold and silver are largely treading water amid a lack of catalysts during the European morning in the run-up to the US jobs report. Spot gold currently resides in a current USD 3,351.49-3,375.29\/oz range, well within yesterday's USD 3,338.29-3,403.15\/oz parameter.Base Metals - Mixed trade across base metals, in fitting with the cautious risk tone ahead of the US jobs report, with the Trump-Xi phone call doing little to keep broader prices underpinned during this session. 3M LME copper dipped back under USD 9,700\/t to trade in a USD 9,659.00-9,768.00\/t range at the time of writing.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

        "title":"Doug Casey On Silver: Money, Markets, & The Metal's Role In The Coming Chaos",
        "description":"Doug Casey On Silver: Money, Markets, & The Metal's Role In The Coming Chaos Via InternationalMan.com,International Man: What is it about silver that makes it viable as a monetary metal\u2014that is, something people actually use to store and exchange value?Doug Casey: Let\u2019s look at the definition of what makes a good money. There are basically six characteristics. A good money has to be durable, divisible, convenient, consistent, have use value, and some limit on supply. Using those six key characteristics, gold ranks first, silver second, and copper third. That\u2019s why those three metals have been preferred money throughout history. They were superior to seashells, salt, cows, paper, and other commodities. In today\u2019s world it makes sense to bring Bitcoin, which also satisfies those six characteristics into the mix.So, to answer the question: Silver has always been a monetary metal, and it likely always will be.International Man: Do you think gold functions better as money than silver\u2014and if so, why? If not, why not?Doug Casey: Gold is much scarcer than silver. It has an extremely high unit value. And its value relative to silver has increased throughout history. In the days of Ancient Egypt, gold traded at only three times the value of silver. In Rome, at the time of Caesar, the gold aureus was worth about 12 times more than the silver denarius. The US initially fixed the value of gold against silver at 17.5 to 1. Incidentally, fixing the value of any commodities\u2014which fluctuate widely for many reasons\u2014is always a bad idea. As of now, the ratio is about 100 to 1. The increase in gold\u2019s value relative to silver is a trend that, with fits and starts, has been in motion for over 3,000 years.It\u2019s important to have an adequate quantity of money available for use in commerce. This was a problem in the early days of the US, when there was neither enough gold nor silver in circulation. Of course, the terms \u201cadequate\u201d and \u201cenough\u201d are rather arbitrary. That\u2019s one reason why money itself should be strictly a function of the free market, not government. If there\u2019s not \u201cenough\u201d gold or silver, more will be mined at a profit. When there\u2019s too much, mining becomes unprofitable, and stops. Unlike government money, free market money is self-regulating.Out of maybe 7 billion ounces of gold that have ever been mined, almost all is stored in vaults, safe deposit boxes, or worn as jewelry. Most is owned by governments and their central banks. It doesn\u2019t circulate in any meaningful way.Governments\u2014including the US government\u2014used to hold large amounts of silver in storage too. But now none do.International Man: The long-term trend has been for silver to be demonetized and increasingly treated as an industrial metal. Do you see that continuing, and what are the implications?Doug Casey: Let\u2019s look at silver as an element. In the past, it was only used as jewelry. But out of the 92 elements, it\u2019s the most reflective and the most conductive of both heat and electricity. There\u2019s every reason to believe that silver is going to gain many more industrial uses over time because of these properties. It\u2019s a high-tech metal.A great deal of silver used to be consumed in photography and X-rays, until a generation ago, but it\u2019s hardly used there at all anymore. Digital photography has nearly replaced it.About 850 million ounces of silver are mined every year, and about another 150 million ounces are recycled. The available supply of bullion, therefore, is about a billion ounces\u2014versus about 100 million ounces of gold. That\u2019s roughly a ten-to-one ratio on the supply side, although most of the silver is \u201cconsumed,\u201d whereas almost all the gold is added to inventory. Since 2019, silver has been in deficit. Roughly 150 million ounces a year have been taken from various stockpiles. That explains why its price has risen to a new base level in the $30 to $35 range, and done better than gold, percentage-wise.And while we\u2019re talking about silver\u2019s unique qualities, it\u2019s worth mentioning that gold also has unique metallic properties. It\u2019s the most non-reactive of all metals; gold doesn\u2019t oxidize. It\u2019s the most ductile, meaning it can be drawn into the thinnest wire of any metal. It\u2019s the most malleable, meaning it can be beaten into the thinnest sheet of all metals.When people talk about gold and silver, they often treat them as if they were one metal. While they do share a lot of characteristics, they each have unique qualities. You\u2019ll notice that, on the Periodic Table of Elements, copper (with 29 protons) is at the top of the file, above silver (with 47), and gold (79). The three metals are closely related atomically, as well as by their traditional use as money.International Man: During times of monetary chaos and runaway inflation, people tend to rush into traditional forms of money\u2014assets that hold value better than rapidly depreciating government paper.Silver often sees a surge in demand during these moments, despite its limited monetary role today.Do you see something like that happening again?Doug Casey: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that we\u2019re heading into a massive monetary crisis. The dollar is going to lose value at an accelerating rate because of the US government\u2019s profligate spending policies.DOGE, which was an excellent idea, has failed; the deficits are going to rise from $2 trillion to $3 trillion. And when the economy takes a downward turn, the government\u2019s tax revenues will fall, even while its obligations rise. I expect that within the next five years, we\u2019ll see $5 to $6 trillion annual deficits.That\u2019s why bonds are in a world of trouble, for reasons we\u2019ve discussed in the past. The stock market is grossly overpriced. Real estate is also in bubble territory, with large carrying costs aggravating the problem. The average guy is likely to rediscover gold, and especially silver.International Man: Where do you see silver prices heading, and what do you think are the best ways to speculate on a rise?Doug Casey: Both gold and silver are in major bull markets. Silver is the poor man\u2019s gold. The average guy, who can\u2019t lay his hands on $500 cash if he needs it, really can\u2019t afford gold. But when he gets scared enough about what\u2019s going on, silver will still be relatively affordable. The average guy will start accumulating silver as a place to hide.I\u2019ve accumulated silver for many years, just like gold. I\u2019ve only bought it, never sold it. The problem with silver is that its unit value is so low, you\u2019d need a vault like Uncle Scrooge to store a substantial amount. That\u2019s not true with gold.That said, everybody should have 100 ounces of silver coins. If you can, set aside a few thousand ounces as a savings vehicle. If the US government succeeds in destroying the dollar, many people are likely to prefer being paid, and buying and selling, with gold and silver coins. They\u2019ll want something real and tangible, not a digital abstraction, or pieces of paper.It really doesn\u2019t matter how high the price of silver goes from a supply point of view. That\u2019s because almost all new silver is a byproduct of mining other metals\u2014gold, copper, lead, and zinc. To major mining companies, silver is only a nice bonus. Even at $100 it won\u2019t have a material effect on their production plans.Years ago, there was a Spokane Stock Exchange. It closed in 1991. Most people are unaware the US used to have a number of regional stock exchanges\u2014Denver for oil, Salt Lake for uranium, and so forth. Scores of small silver stocks were traded in Spokane. From about 1960 to 1970, those little penny stocks went up by orders of magnitude. The boom was chronicled in a book called \u201cSmall Fortunes in Penny Gold Stocks.\u201d The best one was Coeur d\u2019Alene Mines, which went from 2 cents to $20. That kind of thing could happen again.There are a few pure publicly traded silver companies now, and they\u2019re generally very small-cap stocks. Institutions don\u2019t own them, and few care about them. However, I think we\u2019re going to see $100 or $200 silver in the next few years, and these stocks should catch fire. There used to be a whole class of investment advisors who published newsletters and made a living beating the drum about silver. They no longer exist. That tells me that silver is under-owned, nobody cares about it, and it\u2019s going higher.I consider silver stocks a superb speculation.* * *Doug Casey\u2019s analysis lays bare the forces reshaping our financial future\u2014and why silver may once again emerge as the \u201cpeople\u2019s money\u201d during times of crisis.

        "title":"Tariffs squeeze off-price retailers more than expected",
        "description":"In December, before Donald Trump was sworn back into office as president, tariffs were already a hot topic. Back then, several analysts saw off-price retailers as sheltered from import duties because so much of their inventory comes from other retailers and brands, which do the importing and pay the duties.But once tariffs became a reality, it became clear that they pose a greater risk to off-pricers than previously thought, according to Evercore ISI analysts led by Michael Binetti. They estimate that, counting both direct and indirect sourcing, 40% of the total containers imported to TJX\u2019s U.S. operations last year were from China, for example.\u201cDo off-pricers quietly have more exposure to China inventory than they let on?\u201d Binetti said in a May research note. \u201cThey do. While the off-pricers claim to have very little direct sourcing from China, we believe a much higher [percentage] of the product they source indirectly is from China.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean that these retailers are in the same boat as most others. The on-again, off-again nature of the tariff policy has sent most retail companies scrambling, and off-price players have reacted deftly, according to Evercore\u2019s research. For the most part, they moved to amass inventory even before the rollout of reciprocal tariffs on April 2, avoided placing orders while levies on goods from China were at 145%, then resumed them once levies plummeted to 30%.\u201cOur store checks and industry conversations suggest the off-pricers quickly pivoted their floors to categories where goods were more readily available,\u201d Binetti said, adding, though, that \u201cthe off-pricers will likely shift goods to \u2018fast boats\u2019 that cost more. Our off-price contacts think container prices could double or more in the near-term.\u201dThe viability of several of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs was called into question Wednesday when the U.S. Court of International Trade issued an injunction against levies on imports from a number of countries, including China, that rely on emergency declarations. Uncertainty persists, however, as an appeals court paused the block on Thursday.Here\u2019s how the big three U.S. off-price companies fared in Q1, and what they\u2019re saying about tariffs, inventory, pricing and more.TJXOn a call with analysts earlier this month, CEO Ernie Herrman described agility in pricing as well as buying, so that customers always find value compared to department stores or specialty stores. He said the company sources less 10% of its inventory directly from China but didn\u2019t elaborate on indirect sourcing.\u201cWhile we're not immune to tariff pressure, we are laser focused on our initiatives to offset them by remaining flexible and executing our opportunistic buying approach,\u201d he said.\u201cAs far as the pricing goes, we will always ensure that we are below \u2014 that we have a gap between us and the out-the-door price at the regular traditional retailers,\u201d he also said. \u201cHaving said that, we believe there's opportunity for us to buy better.\u201dTJX missed expectations in Q1, with gross margin down slightly compared to last year at 29.5% and net income down 3.2% to just over $1 billion. Wells Fargo analysts called the quarter \u201cgood (not great)\u201d at TJX, noting \u201csome squishiness\u201d on gross margin.Overall, net sales in the period rose 5% year over year to $13.1 billion, with comps up 3%. At the company\u2019s U.S. Marmaxx unit (TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Sierra), net sales rose 4% to $8 billion and comps rose 2%. At its U.S. HomeGoods unit (HomeGoods and Homesense), net sales rose 8% to $2.3 billion and comps rose 4%. The company maintained its guidance for the year.Ross StoresNew import levies are impacting Ross Stores\u2019 operations in a way that TJX has largely escaped, according to Evercore and Wells Fargo analysts. The retailer, which runs Ross and DD\u2019s Discounts stores, pulled its guidance for the year in light of supply and demand volatility caused by tariffs.\u201cWhile 1Q itself was \u2018fine\u2019 ... the bigger issue is that following TJX's recent print (where they effectively told us tariffs are not material)...[Ross] is telling us they are material,\u201d Wells Fargo analysts led by Ike Boruchow said in a May research note.While Ross directly imports only a small portion of its merchandise, more than half of all the merchandise it sells originates in China, CEO Jim Conroy told analysts on an earnings call. This confirms the thesis that off-price is more vulnerable to tariffs than expected, according to a May 22 research note from Evercore.The guidance pullback is likely \u201cmore due to inventory uncertainty than the actual direct financial impact of tariffs,\u201d Evercore\u2019s Binetti said. \u201cBy comparison, TJX didn\u2019t get tripped up by China exposure, but our channel work highlighted TJX began aggressively moving out of China well in advance.\u201dAccording to Conroy, there is only so much that can be done.\u201cThere's multiple things we can do to try to source product from other countries. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of product, particularly over the next six months, that's going to be imported from China for us and for every other retailer and every other off-price company,\u201d he said. \u201cSo ... the amount of flexibility that you have as you sit in the middle of the year for the next three to six months is somewhat limited.\u201dStill, margin pressures could diminish after Q2, according to Evercore analysts. \u201cWe think [Ross] pulled its guidance on little visibility to the back half as the tariff dynamics rapidly change,\u201d they said. \u201cBut [the retailer] is a very aggressive negotiator.\u201dIn Q1, sales rose 2.6% year over year to $5 billion, with flat comps. Operating margin of 12.2% was also flat to last year, and net earnings edged down 1.8% to $479 million. Conroy reiterated that Ross in particular and off-price more generally is well-positioned to weather, and even benefit, from the disruption from the aggressive U.S. trade policy \u201conce we get beyond this near-term, given just this disruption in the economy and in mainstream retail.\u201dBurlingtonBurlington CEO Michael O\u2019Sullivan told analysts Thursday that major supply disruptions for other retailers often ultimately burnish the off-price pipeline, but warned that tariffs aren\u2019t working that way so far. That\u2019s in part because tariffs can cause not just excess supply but also shortages.\u201cEvents like financial crises, disruptive weather, economic downturns, port strikes and other forms of disruption often lead to excess supply, which off-price retailers can benefit from,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, we think that the potential impact of tariffs is more complex and carries greater risk than other types of disruption.\u201dSteep levies on Chinese goods \u201ceffectively shut down the flow of merchandise,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that had continued, it would have been bad for consumers and bad for retailers, and that includes off-price retailers.\u201dStill, like TJX, Burlington reaffirmed its full-year guidance. On a call with analysts Thursday, CFO Kristin Wolfe emphasized that this assumes tariffs won\u2019t increase.Burlington likely moved more quickly than Ross to shift sourcing away from China and probably has less indirect China sourcing to begin with, according to Evercore analysts. Its shares also likely got a boost from Wednesday's court decision, various analysts said, though that decision has since been paused as court rulings continue.\u201cAny removal of tariffs is likely a positive, not only from a cost standpoint but also in the tempering of potential inflation, which we believe hit Burlington\u2019s customers particularly hard coming out of the pandemic,\u201d William Blair analysts Dylan Carden and Anna Linscott said in emailed comments.In Q1, Burlington\u2019s net sales rose just over 6% year over year to $2.5 billion, with comps flat. Gross margin expanded by 30 basis points to 43.8%. Net income rose 28.4% to $100.8 million. Regardless of how tariffs shake out, suppliers and retailers will eventually adjust, O\u2019Sullivan said.\u201cThe way to think about tariffs is that they are just one more thing,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, they are going to create uncertainty in the short term, which we will navigate, but they are not likely to affect the longer term structural trends in our industry. As we have discussed in the past, we see these longer term trends as being favorable for off price and our business.\u201d",

        "title":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall",
        "description":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall India's central bank shocked markets this morning when it slashing interest rates (in a 5:1 vote) by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row - and the largest rate cut since the covid crash, amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy. It also spiked the amount of liquidity available in the system to kickstart moribund lending. The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years, following two previous 25bps reductions in April and February.Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is \"lower than our aspirations\" and the bank felt it was \"imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment\" amid rising global uncertainties.Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The world's (newly) most populous country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices.RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. Inflation for Fiscal Year 2026 has been revised down to 3.7% from 4%, with Q1 (April- June) projected at just 2.9%. Growth forecast remains unchanged at 6.5%. This growth is well below the 8% growth the RBI aspires for.There was another big surprise in today's announcement: alongside the greater than expected cut, the central bank changed its monetary policy stance from \"accommodative\" to \"neutral\", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves, a move which was viewed as hawkish, and sparking a sharp curve steepening. The change in stance suggests the bar for further rate cuts is now higher. As the RBI noted, after 100bps of cuts since February, policy space is now limited.However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low.The RBI also unexpectedly cut the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) rate starting September 2025 , which is set to release INR2.5tn into the banking system. With liquidity already in surplus, overnight rates may now move closer to the SDF, 25bps below the repo rate.Credit growth remains weak at 9.8% YoY (vs 19.5% a year ago). The CRR cut, to be implemented in four 25bps tranches starting September, aims to improve credit transmission. The Governor noted that announcing the schedule in advance is meant to reassure banks of the RBI\u2019s commitment to supporting liquiditySome more details from Goldman Sachs:Policy rate - lowered by 50bp with a 5:1 vote: The RBI MPC voted 5:1 to lower the policy repo rate by 50bp to 5.50% at the June meeting, vs. an expectation of a 25bp repo rate cut. External Member Bhattacharya voted for a 25bp repo rate cut. Consequently, both the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate were lowered by 50bp each to 5.75% and 5.25%, respectively.Policy stance changed to 'neutral': The MPC changed its policy stance back to 'neutral' from 'accommodative'. The Governor clarified that \"after having reduced the policy repo rate by 100 bps in quick succession since February 2025, under the current circumstances, monetary policy is left with very limited space to support growth\". We interpret this as the end of the current rate easing cycle with repo rate at 5.50% -- implying ~1% real policy rate on a one-year forward inflation forecast. The RBI may not want the ex-ante real rate below 1%, in our view, especially when the growth outlook is balanced. We had been forecasting a 5.50% repo rate marking the end of the cycle, with 25bp rate cuts each in June and August meetings, but the RBI got there a meeting faster than we expected.Growth forecast retained at 6.5% yoy for FY26: The RBI retained their growth forecast at 6.5% yoy for FY26 (GSe: 6.2% yoy), noting strong agricultural sector growth and rural demand, and a resilient services sector underpinning a recovery in urban demand. However, the Governor highlighted downside risks to growth from US \"reciprocal\" tariff-related uncertainty and prolonged geopolitical tensions.Inflation forecast lowered by 30bp to 3.7% yoy for FY26: The RBI lowered its inflation forecast by 30bp to 3.7% yoy (GSe: 3.6% yoy) (Exhibit 1). The Governor highlighted that there is \u201cgreater confidence of headline inflation remaining below the target of 4% over the course of the year\u201d. Food inflation is likely to remain benign given higher wheat and pulses (legumes) production. Additionally, Indian Meteorological Department\u2019s expectations of an above-normal monsoon bode well for the production of summer crops. However, the Governor also highlighted upside risks to the inflation outlook from weather and US \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff-related uncertainty.Banking system liquidity: The RBI announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 100bp to 3.0% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in four tranches from September to November to ease banking system liquidity further. As per the RBI\u2019s estimate, this measure is expected to release durable liquidity of INR 2.5tn (0.7% of GDP) into the banking system.The Governor said that the RBI \u201cremains committed to provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system\". With durable liquidity already in surplus in recent months, overnight rates have traded on an average ~20bp below the repo rate from April to June (Exhibit 2), resulting in a significant easing in financial conditions. As a result, overnight rates have come off by more than 150bp from mid-January to now.India's lower borrowing costs will have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector.\"This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,\" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.Predictably, Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement. Looking ahead, Goldman expects the RBI to stay on hold for the rest of the year unless growth slows sharply. The front end of the IGB curve should remain supported by strong liquidity and favorable demand-supply dynamics. The bank favors 2Y IGB and expect the IGB curve to steepen.

        "title":"The \u2018cracks in the foundation' of the job market are starting to show, economist says\u2014and the big picture is worse than it seems",
        "description":"The latest economic reports show a surprisingly stable U.S. job market, but there are \u201ccracks in the foundation\u201d that could spell trouble for workers in the coming months, according to Andrew Flowers, chief economist at Appcast, a recruitment marketing provider.The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, beating expectations and down slightly from 147,000 in April, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% while the underemployed rate, or the share of part-time workers who want full-time jobs, remained unchanged at 7.8%.Looking at the bigger picture, the job market is \u201ctreading water\u201d and \u201cworse than what the topline number says,\u201d Flowers tells CNBC Make It. The economy netted an average 144,000 new jobs every month in the last year. That\u2019s the lowest since 2011, excluding the pandemic-era drop, Flowers says .Meanwhile, the bulk of available positions come from health care, leisure and hospitality, and social assistance. These sectors generally fuel a lot of new work, but tariffs and health-care policies in the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d could limit their growth, Flowers says.The spending bill, which passed the House and is now under consideration in the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $700 billion and make signing up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces harder and more expensive.Federal funding cuts to health care, which has accounted for roughly 30% of new jobs in the past three years, could \u201ckill the golden goose, so to speak,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cHealth care has been the one stalwart industry to power job growth.\u201dLeisure and hospitality work could similarly be in danger as businesses pass the cost of new tariffs on to customers, and consumers pull back on spending, Flowers says.Tariffs are already \u201cstarting to bite,\u201d Flowers adds, pointing to declines in the warehousing and retail jobs that buoyed April job growth. \u201cGoing forward, a lot of the eggs are in one basket, which is health care.\u201d\u2018The job-finding rate is really slipping\u2019The job-search experience, meanwhile, remains challenging.Some 40% of job-seekers are not confident in the number of jobs available today, and nearly a third expect fewer jobs to be available six months from now, according to ZipRecruiter\u2019s latest job-seeker confidence index.\u201cIt\u2019s an insider vs. outsider labor market,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cIf you have a job, it\u2019s actually pretty good.\u201d Layoffs are relatively low while the unemployment rate is steady and wage growth is strong. But \u201cthe job-finding rate is really slipping\u201d for those on the market, especially for entry-level workers getting their first jobs out of high school or college, Flowers says.Growth is weak around knowledge-worker jobs in finance, marketing, sales and software development, while the professional and business services sector sheds jobs, Flowers says.\u2018We\u2019ve told young people in this country for decades, \u2018Go to college.\u2019 And they did,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cNow all the jobs they want, whether it\u2019s in tech, marketing, sales, banking or for the federal government, those are all the weakest areas.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on this collision course where young people are going to face a harder time getting the jobs that they wanted, but all the blue-collar jobs are going to be very hard to fill,\u201d Flowers says.Overall, the U.S. economy has contracted over the last six weeks, as shown in declining business growth, higher prices and slower hiring, according to a new Federal Reserve report.\u201cAll Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions,\u201d according to the report. It noted hiring was \u201clittle changed\u201d and \u201cflat\u201d in some districts where candidate pools are growing, but turnover remains stubbornly low.Are you ready to buy a house?

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%. European equities are little changed as investors search for fresh catalysts on trade negotiations between the US and China and look ahead to a key US jobs report.

WSJWe estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 110k in May, below consensus of 125k and the three-month average of +155k. On the positive side, big data indicators suggested a healthy pace of job creation. On the negative side, trade policy uncertainty was very high across the survey period and we expect another 10k decline in federal government payrolls from workforce reductions.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

Economists expect growth of 125,000 jobs, according to Dow Jones, which would represent a decline from the prior month but likely not enough of one to cause a surge in recession fears.Some recent economic data has pointed to a slowdown in the U.S., raising questions about the impact of the multi-front tariff negotiations and the next steps for the Federal Reserve.\u201cThe Federal Reserve is navigating a narrow path. While they expect the economy to soften, persistent trade uncertainty is ripe ground for monetary policy missteps. ... With both large and small businesses indicating that they plan to hold onto their workers and ride out the tariff storm, only a modest weakening in the jobs market is likely, further reducing the urgency for Fed support,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.The move in futures comes as the major indexes are holding on to modest gains for the week.

        "description":"US Equity Futures Unchanged Ahead Of ECB As Jobs Data Looms US equity futures are unchanged, as they struggle for direction ahead of Friday\u2019s payrolls report, following a series of data releases that offered mixed signals on the health of the economy. As of 8:00am, S&P futures are flat, having traded on either side of the unchanged line during the overnight session and followed a slurry of weak macro data releases which saw Wednesday's gains erase and recover, with the S&P ultimately ending the day flat. Nasdaq 100 futs are down 0.1% with Mag 7 stocks mostly higher except for TSLA (-1.6%). Stocks and bonds in Europe gained ahead of the ECB's expected 8th consecutive interest rate cut. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries steadied as Wednesday\u2019s bond rally faded. The dollar reversed earlier losses even as gold surged to briefly top $3400. Commodities are mostly mixed with notable outperformance in silver (+3.1%). News flow since yesterday\u2019s close has been largely muted: headlines continue to focus on trade negotiation development, particularly implication on rare earth curbs (BBG and CNBC) and upcoming Trump-Xi call.In premarket trading, the Mag 7 stocks are mixed (Alphabet +1.3%, Amazon +0.7%, Meta +0.2%, Microsoft 0%, Tesla -2.6%, Nvidia -0.5%, Apple -0.3%). Broadcom shares rise 1% in premarket ahead of earnings due after the bell. Chewy shares (CHWY) are down 2.4% premarket after Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala cut the recommendation on the online retailer of pet products to hold from buy, writing that valuation appears \u201cprimed\u201d for a first-quarter beat and raise that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Dollar Tree Inc. shares (DLTR) are up 1.6% in premarket trading, after JPMorgan upgraded the discount retailer to overweight from neutral. Here are some other notable movers: Five Below (FIVE) gains 6% in premarket trading after the discount stores company reported first-quarter results that beat expectations and guided for net sales in the second quarter that are above estimates.Nebius shares (NBIS) gain 5.6% in US premarket trading after the AI infrastructure software provider is initiated with a buy rating at Arete Research, while peer CoreWeave declines 2% after getting new neutral rating.PVH shares (PVH) drop 7.9% in premarket trading after the Calvin Klein owner cut its full-year adjusted earnings guidance, and noted that the outlook reflects an estimated net negative impact in relation to tariffs placed on goods coming into the US.Planet Labs shares (PL) jump 20% in premarket trading after first-quarter revenue beat estimates. Analysts at Citizens said the satellite data provider had a \u201cstellar quarter\u201d and the stock remains an opportunity for long-term capital appreciation.Visa shares (V) rise 1% in premarket trading on Thursday as Mizuho Securities raises the stock to outperform from neutral, saying the cash-to-card runway in the US still has room to grow.The wild swings in stocks that were sparked by the Trump administration\u2019s tariff announcements in April \u2014 and subsequent rebound \u2014 have given way to more subdued daily moves in recent weeks. The US benchmark has remained largely flat since mid-May as traders assess the impact of the trade war on economic activity.Friday\u2019s jobs report is expected to show that growth in nonfarm payrolls slowed and the unemployment rate remained steady. While the figures would chime with Wednesday data that showed a contraction in US services and a deceleration in private hiring, separate data earlier in the week unexpectedly showed a fairly broad advance in US job openings.\u201cConsensus is for lower job creation,\u201d said Ulrich Urbahn, head of multi-asset strategy and research at Berenberg. \u201cI think there must be a big surprise to the downside for volatility to increase.\u201dSome investors are warning that the current period of relative market calm could once again give way to volatility, as uncertainty lingers over the outcome of trade negotiations between the US and its biggest trading partners \u2014 and the full economic impact remains unclear.\u201cOur bias remains to sell any rallies\u201d in US bonds, said Mohit Kumar, chief European strategist at Jefferies International. \u201cWe are concerned over the fiscal deficits and the willingness of the rest of the world to continue financing US fiscal deficits.\u201dThe European Central Bank is set to cut rates for an eighth time later on Thursday. Another reduction is expected in September, when trade talks with the US should have concluded and fresh forecasts will reveal the full implications of the tariffs. And speaking of Europe, the Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, rising for a third day ahead of a widely anticipated interest-rate cut by the European Central Bank. European stocks were on track for the highest close in more than two weeks. Technology, construction and health care stocks are leading gains while travel and retail provide a drag. Here are the biggest European movers:Bayer shares rise as much as 5.1% after Goldman Sachs upgrades the German chemicals and pharmaceutical company to buy from neutral, saying it sees earnings as having bottomed out and thinks risks around litigation and pharma data are overdone.Dr. Martens surges as much as 17%, the most since November, after the UK bootmaker releases its full-year results and outlines its new \u2018Levers For Growth\u2019 strategy update.Redcare shares rise as much as 2.3%, paring some of Wednesday\u2019s 14% drop that was spurred by a rating downgrade at Kepler Cheuvreux.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 0.4%, heading for its highest level in more than three years. Korea\u2019s Kospi Index jumped 1.5% after the ruling party said it will propose a revision to Commercial Act again, a key step in improving corporate governance. Benchmarks in Hong Kong and Taiwan also gained, with US economic data starting to soften and supporting the case for an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Japanese shares fell. Demand at the country\u2019s 30-year bond auction was weaker than the average over the past year. The regional benchmark\u2019s gain in recent weeks is in tandem with global peers, which closed at a record high Wednesday on expectations that the worst of higher tariffs may be over. Still, uncertainty remains high around the progress of US-China trade talks, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping making clear that a phone call doesn\u2019t come without a price. That\u2019s even as Trump is seeking a personal discussion with Beijing to prevent further escalation in trade tensions.In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is unchanged. The Japanese yen is the weakest of the G-10 currencies, falling 0.3% against the greenback. The kiwi tops the leader board with a 0.4% gain. The euro traded steady after advancing more than 10% against the dollar year-to-date.In rates, treasuries are mixed with gains only seen at the longer end of the curve. US 30-year yields fall 2 bps to 4.86%. European government bonds advance across all maturities, with UK and German 10-year yields falling 3-4 bps each. Japanese government bonds rose after an auction of 30-year debt was better than many investors had feared. Still, a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.92 at the offering pointed to a general lack of appetite for longer-maturity debt.MarketsIn commodities, oil prices are steady with WTI near $63 a barrel. Spot gold rises $12 to around $3,385\/oz. Silver rises 3% and above $35\/oz for the time since 2012.Looking to the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference.

This follows a session of losses on Wednesday which were triggered by soft outturns for US ADP and ISM services PMIs. Newsflow since has been on the quiet side, aside from President Trump calling for a scrapping of the debt limit; something that appears to be very unlikely to be implemented. As such, focus will remain on the labour market for now (pending any major trade updates) with weekly claims, Challenger Layoffs due on today's docket, with Fed speak also due.

So investors became a lot more confident that the Fed would still cut rates this year, and the 10yr Treasury yield fell -10.0bps on the day to 4.36%. That decline in yields had the double benefit of easing financial conditions, whilst also relaxing fears about the fiscal situation. So equities held up despite the underwhelming data, with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly reaching a 3-month high. Indeed, the index is now up +19.83% since its closing low after Liberation Day, leaving it just shy of the 20% mark that would mark the technical start of a bull market.Of course, even with the rally, the data still raised fears that the US economy lost steam into May. That started off with the ADP\u2019s report of private payrolls, which was the softest in over two years, at just +37k (vs. +114k expected). And shortly after that, we had the ISM services index, which fell to 49.9 (vs. 52.0 expected), and the details from the report weren\u2019t great either. For instance, the new orders component slumped to a two-year low of 46.4, whilst the prices paid indicator surged to 68.7, the highest since 2022. Nevertheless, investors weren\u2019t too alarmed by these data prints, as the numbers weren\u2019t so bad as to revive fears about a recession. Indeed, it\u2019s worth noting that the ISM services index had a big move lower back in December 2022, at a time when the Fed were aggressively hiking rates, which was then followed up by a strong recovery the following month. So in general, investors were reluctant to over-interpret one day\u2019s data, not least given the big test is coming tomorrow with the US jobs report. Moreover, there was a more positive signal from the final US composite PMI for May, which was revised up from the flash reading to 53.0. In terms of the market reaction, both the ADP and the ISM services prints led investors to price in more rate cuts this year, with clear moves in response to the two prints. In fact by the close, futures were pricing in 58bps of rate cuts by the Fed\u2019s December meeting, up +8.0bps on the day, and the highest number in over three weeks. And there\u2019s growing confidence that we\u2019ll see the first rate cut by September, with futures now almost fully pricing (97%) one by that meeting. Given the additional rate cuts being priced, that triggered a major surge for US Treasuries yesterday. So at the front end, the 2yr yield was down -8.5bps on the day to 3.87%. And for the 30yr yield, the -10.3bps move was actually the biggest daily decline since February, pushing the yield down to 4.88%. Only a small amount of that rally has unwound this morning, with the 10yr yield up +0.6bps, and the 30yr yield up +0.5bps.The large slide in Treasury yields had the added benefit of reassuring investors about the fiscal situation, which had been in growing focus as the 30yr yield hovered around the 5% mark. So even with the weak economic data, risk assets held up reasonably well with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly posting a 3-month high in a session that saw the lowest daily trading range for the index since mid-February. The S&P 500 now stands just -2.82% beneath its all-time high in February, although futures this morning aren\u2019t suggesting much momentum, with those on the S&P 500 down -0.05%.Meanwhile in Europe, there were consistent gains, with the STOXX 600 (+0.47%) advancing for a second day. There was some support from the final PMI numbers, with the Euro Area composite revised up from the flash reading to 50.2 (vs. flash 49.5). So that meant it was no longer beneath the 50-mark pointing towards a contraction. Over in Germany, the DAX (+0.77%) even hit a fresh record, which came as the cabinet approved a new package of corporate tax breaks. For sovereign bonds, there was a steadier performance across the continent, with yields on 10yr bunds (+0.1bps), OATs (+1.3bps) and BTPs (-0.3bps) seeing modest movements. Yesterday also brought headlines in the geopolitical sphere, although markets weren\u2019t too reactive to the various stories. Before the European open, President Trump said that President Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d So that led to a very modest slide in US equity futures. Meanwhile, Trump also posted about a conversation with Russian President Putin, which he said was \u201cnot a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.\u201d Otherwise on the trade front, there were positive noises from the US-EU trade negotiations. EU trade commissioner Maros\u030c S\u030cefc\u030covic\u030c tweeted that \u201cWe\u2019re advancing in the right direction at pace \u2013 and staying in close contact to maintain the momentum.\u201d Similarly, US trade representative Jamieson Greer said that \u201cI am pleased that negotiations are advancing quickly\u201d. Overnight in Asia we\u2019ve seen a pretty mixed performance from the major equity indices. In Japan, the Nikkei is down -0.46%, which follows a weak auction of 30yr debt, where there was the weakest demand since 2023. However, bond markets haven\u2019t reacted badly, with the 30yr yield coming down -6.6bps this morning. By contrast, South Korea\u2019s KOSPI (+1.05%) has built on yesterday\u2019s +2.66% gain, with the index currently on track to close at its highest level since mid-July. Otherwise, the Hang Seng (+0.42%) is on track for a third consecutive advance, whilst the CSI 300 (+0.07%) and the Shanghai Comp (+0.08%) have also posted modest gains this morning. Looking forward, central banks will be in the spotlight today, as the ECB are announcing their latest policy decision at 13:15 London time. It\u2019s widely expected that they\u2019ll deliver another 25bp rate cut, taking their deposit rate down to 2%. However, after a succession of consecutive cuts, there\u2019s more doubt on what happens after this meeting into year-end, as this cut would take them broadly into the middle of the neutral range. In their preview (link here), our European economists expect the ECB to keep the meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to setting policy. However, they think getting the hawks to support a June cut might require a hint of conditional patience, including an implicit willingness to pause at the next meeting in July and wait until September. Staying on central banks, the Bank of Canada left their policy rate on hold at 2.75% yesterday, in line with expectations. Afterwards, Governor Macklem said \u201cthere was a clear consensus to hold policy unchanged as we gain more information\u201d. And in future, he said \u201cmembers thought there could be a need for a reduction in the policy rate if the economy weakens in the face of continued US tariffs and uncertainty, and cost pressures on inflation are contained.\u201d By the close, the Canadian dollar had strengthened +0.31% against the US Dollar to its strongest level since early October. However, that was mainly a function of US dollar weakness, with the US Dollar weakening against every other G10 currency yesterday after the weaker US data.To the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hear from the Fed\u2019s Kugler, Harker and Schmid, BoE Deputy Governor Breeden, and the BoE\u2019s Greene. Data releases from the UK include the weekly initial jobless claims and the April trade balance. Meanwhile in Europe, there\u2019s German factory orders for April, and the May construction PMIs for Germany and the UK. Tyler DurdenThu, 06\/05\/2025 - 08:15",

        "title":"ECB Preview: 8th Rate Cut In A Row",
        "description":"ECB Preview: 8th Rate Cut In A Row As UBS economist Paul Donovan writes this morning, a total of 52 out of 52 surveyed economists - not to mention markets - expect a quarter point ECB rate reduction today, the 8th in a row, adding rhetorically \"How could so many economists possibly be wrong?\" More to the point, he adds that President Trump is likely to become even more irate after criticizing the Federal Reserve for not cutting rates. Rhetorical questions aside, here is what to expected, courtesy of NewsquawkOVERVIEW: Given the uncertainties surrounding the trade outlook and progress on the inflation front, the ECB is expected to cut the deposit Rate by 25bps to 2.00%. With a rate reduction nailed on, focus will be on any hints over future easing plans. While Lagarde might not make any explicit mention of the future policy direction, any signs of dissent, whether via remarks by the President or sources after the meeting, could provide a guiding star for markets. Currently, markets see a total of 54bps of loosening by year-end (including the expected June cut).PRIOR MEETING: April\u02bcs meeting saw a 25bps cut as expected and the old language around restrictiveness was removed. This took the ECB to the top end of its 1.75-2.25% neutral rate estimate. Accompanying forward guidance was unsurprisingly non-committal, though the statement did highlight increased uncertainty and an associated confidence impact that is \u201clikely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions\u201d; on this, participants were attentive to any hints around an offsetting policy response (i.e. dovish action). Just after the meeting, sources reported the decision to cut was unanimous. Lagarde didn\u02bct add too much, aside from stressing no argument was made for 50bps or other stimulus, though she made the point that they are viewing tariffs as a demand shock.RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS : Flash inflation data for May saw Y\/Y HICP decline to 1.9% from 2.2% (below target for the first time since September 2024). Core inflation declined to 2.4% from 2.7%, whilst services inflation saw a notable fall to 3.7% from 4.0%. The ECB Consumer Expectations Survey for April saw the 12-month ahead metric rise to 3.1% from 2.9%. In terms of market gauges, the EZ 5y5y inflation forward has ticked higher to 2.06% vs. circa 2.03% at the time of the prior meeting. On the growth front, Q1 GDP is currently estimated at 0.3% Q\/Q vs. the Q4 print of 0.2%. More timely survey data from S&P Global showed manufacturing PMI for May climbed to 49.4 from 49.0, services slipped to 48.9 from 50.1, leaving the composite at 49.5 vs. prev. 50.4. The accompanying release noted \u201cthe eurozone economy just cannot seem to find its footing\u201d. The unemployment rate remains at the historic low of 6.2%.RECENT COMMUNICATIONS: Since the prior meeting, President Lagarde has remarked that levies are probably more disinflationary than inflationary. However, the net effect of tariffs is still uncertain. Chief Economist Lane is confident that the Bank\u02bcs task to bring inflation back to 2% is \u201cmostly completed\u201d, however, services inflation is \"still too high\". The influential Schnabel of Germany is of the view that tariffs could be disinflationary in the short run but result in upside risk over the medium term. France's Villeroy has stated that interest rate normalisation within the EZ is probably incomplete. Typically-dovish, Panetta of Italy has remarked that there is reduced room to cut rates further, though the macro outlook is weak and trade tensions could weigh on this. Elsewhere, Cyprus' Patsalides has noted that a 50bp cut would only be justified if recession risks intensified with stronger disinflation. At the hawkish end of the spectrum, Austria\u02bcs Holzmann thinks the Bank should not lower rates in June or July.RATES: Consensus looks for the ECB to cut rates by 25bps with markets assigning a 95% chance of such an outcome. Since the prior meeting, whilst there has been an easing of tensions between the US and China, which led to an improvement in the global trade outlook, a deal between the EU and the US remains elusive. The lack of progress prompted US President Trump to recommend a 50% tariff on the EU as of June 1st. This threat has since been pushed back to July 9th and the EU is increasing efforts to get an agreement. However, large gaps between the two sides remain and the growth outlook remains uncertain. Furthermore, as detailed above, progress on the inflation front means that policymakers have the green light to ease policy (also aided by the stronger EUR and declining oil prices). Assuming the ECB cuts by 25bps this week, the focus will be on any clues as to what comes thereafter, given the apparent split of views on the GC. The accounts of the ECB meeting (albeit when trade tensions were higher) showed that some members would have been comfortable with a 50bps reduction. Some of the more hawkish members on the GC may opt to dissent to the decision with Holzmann of the view that the ECB should not cut rates in June or July. Currently, markets see a total of 54bps of loosening by year-end (including the expected June cut).MACRO PROJECTIONS: For the accompanying macro projections, Rabobank expects growth to be revised down a touch for both 2025 and 2026 while the inflation view is likely to be trimmed for 2025 to 2.0% (Mar. 2.3%) but increased for 2026 to 2.3% (Mar. 2.0%).HICP INFLATION: 2025: 2.3%2026: 1.9%2027: 2.0%HICP CORE INFLATION (EX-ENERGY & FOOD): 2025: 2.2%2026: 2.0%2027: 1.9%GDP: 2025: 0.9%2026: 1.2%2027: 1.3% Tyler DurdenThu, 06\/05\/2025 - 07:45",

        "title":"The \u2018cracks in the foundation' of the job market are starting to show, economist says\u2014and the big picture is worse than it seems",
        "description":"The latest economic reports show a surprisingly stable U.S. job market, but there are \u201ccracks in the foundation\u201d that could spell trouble for workers in the coming months, according to Andrew Flowers, chief economist at Appcast, a recruitment marketing provider.The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, beating expectations and down slightly from 147,000 in April, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% while the underemployed rate, or the share of part-time workers who want full-time jobs, remained unchanged at 7.8%.Looking at the bigger picture, the job market is \u201ctreading water\u201d and \u201cworse than what the topline number says,\u201d Flowers tells CNBC Make It. The economy netted an average 144,000 new jobs every month in the last year. That\u2019s the lowest since 2011, excluding the pandemic-era drop, Flowers says .Meanwhile, the bulk of available positions come from health care, leisure and hospitality, and social assistance. These sectors generally fuel a lot of new work, but tariffs and health-care policies in the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d could limit their growth, Flowers says.The spending bill, which passed the House and is now under consideration in the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $700 billion and make signing up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces harder and more expensive.Federal funding cuts to health care, which has accounted for roughly 30% of new jobs in the past three years, could \u201ckill the golden goose, so to speak,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cHealth care has been the one stalwart industry to power job growth.\u201dLeisure and hospitality work could similarly be in danger as businesses pass the cost of new tariffs on to customers, and consumers pull back on spending, Flowers says.Tariffs are already \u201cstarting to bite,\u201d Flowers adds, pointing to declines in the warehousing and retail jobs that buoyed April job growth. \u201cGoing forward, a lot of the eggs are in one basket, which is health care.\u201d\u2018The job-finding rate is really slipping\u2019The job-search experience, meanwhile, remains challenging.Some 40% of job-seekers are not confident in the number of jobs available today, and nearly a third expect fewer jobs to be available six months from now, according to ZipRecruiter\u2019s latest job-seeker confidence index.\u201cIt\u2019s an insider vs. outsider labor market,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cIf you have a job, it\u2019s actually pretty good.\u201d Layoffs are relatively low while the unemployment rate is steady and wage growth is strong. But \u201cthe job-finding rate is really slipping\u201d for those on the market, especially for entry-level workers getting their first jobs out of high school or college, Flowers says.Growth is weak around knowledge-worker jobs in finance, marketing, sales and software development, while the professional and business services sector sheds jobs, Flowers says.\u2018We\u2019ve told young people in this country for decades, \u2018Go to college.\u2019 And they did,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cNow all the jobs they want, whether it\u2019s in tech, marketing, sales, banking or for the federal government, those are all the weakest areas.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on this collision course where young people are going to face a harder time getting the jobs that they wanted, but all the blue-collar jobs are going to be very hard to fill,\u201d Flowers says.Overall, the U.S. economy has contracted over the last six weeks, as shown in declining business growth, higher prices and slower hiring, according to a new Federal Reserve report.\u201cAll Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions,\u201d according to the report. It noted hiring was \u201clittle changed\u201d and \u201cflat\u201d in some districts where candidate pools are growing, but turnover remains stubbornly low.Are you ready to buy a house?

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

        "description":"ECB Preview: 8th Rate Cut In A Row As UBS economist Paul Donovan writes this morning, a total of 52 out of 52 surveyed economists - not to mention markets - expect a quarter point ECB rate reduction today, the 8th in a row, adding rhetorically \"How could so many economists possibly be wrong?\" More to the point, he adds that President Trump is likely to become even more irate after criticizing the Federal Reserve for not cutting rates. Rhetorical questions aside, here is what to expected, courtesy of NewsquawkOVERVIEW: Given the uncertainties surrounding the trade outlook and progress on the inflation front, the ECB is expected to cut the deposit Rate by 25bps to 2.00%. With a rate reduction nailed on, focus will be on any hints over future easing plans. While Lagarde might not make any explicit mention of the future policy direction, any signs of dissent, whether via remarks by the President or sources after the meeting, could provide a guiding star for markets. Currently, markets see a total of 54bps of loosening by year-end (including the expected June cut).PRIOR MEETING: April\u02bcs meeting saw a 25bps cut as expected and the old language around restrictiveness was removed. This took the ECB to the top end of its 1.75-2.25% neutral rate estimate. Accompanying forward guidance was unsurprisingly non-committal, though the statement did highlight increased uncertainty and an associated confidence impact that is \u201clikely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions\u201d; on this, participants were attentive to any hints around an offsetting policy response (i.e. dovish action). Just after the meeting, sources reported the decision to cut was unanimous. Lagarde didn\u02bct add too much, aside from stressing no argument was made for 50bps or other stimulus, though she made the point that they are viewing tariffs as a demand shock.RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS : Flash inflation data for May saw Y\/Y HICP decline to 1.9% from 2.2% (below target for the first time since September 2024). Core inflation declined to 2.4% from 2.7%, whilst services inflation saw a notable fall to 3.7% from 4.0%. The ECB Consumer Expectations Survey for April saw the 12-month ahead metric rise to 3.1% from 2.9%. In terms of market gauges, the EZ 5y5y inflation forward has ticked higher to 2.06% vs. circa 2.03% at the time of the prior meeting. On the growth front, Q1 GDP is currently estimated at 0.3% Q\/Q vs. the Q4 print of 0.2%. More timely survey data from S&P Global showed manufacturing PMI for May climbed to 49.4 from 49.0, services slipped to 48.9 from 50.1, leaving the composite at 49.5 vs. prev. 50.4. The accompanying release noted \u201cthe eurozone economy just cannot seem to find its footing\u201d. The unemployment rate remains at the historic low of 6.2%.RECENT COMMUNICATIONS: Since the prior meeting, President Lagarde has remarked that levies are probably more disinflationary than inflationary. However, the net effect of tariffs is still uncertain. Chief Economist Lane is confident that the Bank\u02bcs task to bring inflation back to 2% is \u201cmostly completed\u201d, however, services inflation is \"still too high\". The influential Schnabel of Germany is of the view that tariffs could be disinflationary in the short run but result in upside risk over the medium term. France's Villeroy has stated that interest rate normalisation within the EZ is probably incomplete. Typically-dovish, Panetta of Italy has remarked that there is reduced room to cut rates further, though the macro outlook is weak and trade tensions could weigh on this. Elsewhere, Cyprus' Patsalides has noted that a 50bp cut would only be justified if recession risks intensified with stronger disinflation. At the hawkish end of the spectrum, Austria\u02bcs Holzmann thinks the Bank should not lower rates in June or July.RATES: Consensus looks for the ECB to cut rates by 25bps with markets assigning a 95% chance of such an outcome. Since the prior meeting, whilst there has been an easing of tensions between the US and China, which led to an improvement in the global trade outlook, a deal between the EU and the US remains elusive. The lack of progress prompted US President Trump to recommend a 50% tariff on the EU as of June 1st. This threat has since been pushed back to July 9th and the EU is increasing efforts to get an agreement. However, large gaps between the two sides remain and the growth outlook remains uncertain. Furthermore, as detailed above, progress on the inflation front means that policymakers have the green light to ease policy (also aided by the stronger EUR and declining oil prices). Assuming the ECB cuts by 25bps this week, the focus will be on any clues as to what comes thereafter, given the apparent split of views on the GC. The accounts of the ECB meeting (albeit when trade tensions were higher) showed that some members would have been comfortable with a 50bps reduction. Some of the more hawkish members on the GC may opt to dissent to the decision with Holzmann of the view that the ECB should not cut rates in June or July. Currently, markets see a total of 54bps of loosening by year-end (including the expected June cut).MACRO PROJECTIONS: For the accompanying macro projections, Rabobank expects growth to be revised down a touch for both 2025 and 2026 while the inflation view is likely to be trimmed for 2025 to 2.0% (Mar. 2.3%) but increased for 2026 to 2.3% (Mar. 2.0%).HICP INFLATION: 2025: 2.3%2026: 1.9%2027: 2.0%HICP CORE INFLATION (EX-ENERGY & FOOD): 2025: 2.2%2026: 2.0%2027: 1.9%GDP: 2025: 0.9%2026: 1.2%2027: 1.3% Tyler DurdenThu, 06\/05\/2025 - 07:45",

        "title":"The \u2018cracks in the foundation' of the job market are starting to show, economist says\u2014and the big picture is worse than it seems",
        "description":"The latest economic reports show a surprisingly stable U.S. job market, but there are \u201ccracks in the foundation\u201d that could spell trouble for workers in the coming months, according to Andrew Flowers, chief economist at Appcast, a recruitment marketing provider.The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, beating expectations and down slightly from 147,000 in April, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% while the underemployed rate, or the share of part-time workers who want full-time jobs, remained unchanged at 7.8%.Looking at the bigger picture, the job market is \u201ctreading water\u201d and \u201cworse than what the topline number says,\u201d Flowers tells CNBC Make It. The economy netted an average 144,000 new jobs every month in the last year. That\u2019s the lowest since 2011, excluding the pandemic-era drop, Flowers says .Meanwhile, the bulk of available positions come from health care, leisure and hospitality, and social assistance. These sectors generally fuel a lot of new work, but tariffs and health-care policies in the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d could limit their growth, Flowers says.The spending bill, which passed the House and is now under consideration in the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $700 billion and make signing up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces harder and more expensive.Federal funding cuts to health care, which has accounted for roughly 30% of new jobs in the past three years, could \u201ckill the golden goose, so to speak,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cHealth care has been the one stalwart industry to power job growth.\u201dLeisure and hospitality work could similarly be in danger as businesses pass the cost of new tariffs on to customers, and consumers pull back on spending, Flowers says.Tariffs are already \u201cstarting to bite,\u201d Flowers adds, pointing to declines in the warehousing and retail jobs that buoyed April job growth. \u201cGoing forward, a lot of the eggs are in one basket, which is health care.\u201d\u2018The job-finding rate is really slipping\u2019The job-search experience, meanwhile, remains challenging.Some 40% of job-seekers are not confident in the number of jobs available today, and nearly a third expect fewer jobs to be available six months from now, according to ZipRecruiter\u2019s latest job-seeker confidence index.\u201cIt\u2019s an insider vs. outsider labor market,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cIf you have a job, it\u2019s actually pretty good.\u201d Layoffs are relatively low while the unemployment rate is steady and wage growth is strong. But \u201cthe job-finding rate is really slipping\u201d for those on the market, especially for entry-level workers getting their first jobs out of high school or college, Flowers says.Growth is weak around knowledge-worker jobs in finance, marketing, sales and software development, while the professional and business services sector sheds jobs, Flowers says.\u2018We\u2019ve told young people in this country for decades, \u2018Go to college.\u2019 And they did,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cNow all the jobs they want, whether it\u2019s in tech, marketing, sales, banking or for the federal government, those are all the weakest areas.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on this collision course where young people are going to face a harder time getting the jobs that they wanted, but all the blue-collar jobs are going to be very hard to fill,\u201d Flowers says.Overall, the U.S. economy has contracted over the last six weeks, as shown in declining business growth, higher prices and slower hiring, according to a new Federal Reserve report.\u201cAll Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions,\u201d according to the report. It noted hiring was \u201clittle changed\u201d and \u201cflat\u201d in some districts where candidate pools are growing, but turnover remains stubbornly low.Are you ready to buy a house?

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%. European equities are little changed as investors search for fresh catalysts on trade negotiations between the US and China and look ahead to a key US jobs report.

Attention now is firmly fixated on today's NFP report which is set to see payroll growth slow to 130k from 177k and unemployment rate hold steady @ 4.2%. As it stands, the next 25bps cut is not fully priced until September with 54bps of loosening seen by year-end. DXY is towards the top end of yesterday's 98.35-98.94 range.EUR - EUR is trivially softer vs. the USD after gaining yesterday on account of the ECB rate decision which saw policymakers pull the trigger on a 25bps rate cut, whilst noting that policy is \"well-positioned\"; suggesting that the ECB could be nearing or at the end of its cutting cycle. ECB speak this morning hasn't shifted the dial with policymakers signalling flexibility going forward, whilst acknowledging progress on inflation. EUR\/USD is contained within yesterday's 1.1404-1.1495 range.JPY - JPY is the laggard across the majors following disappointing Household Spending data. Subsequently, USD\/JPY briefly made its way back onto a 144 handle with a current session peak @ 144.13, stopping shy of the WTD high @ 144.39. On the trade front, Japan's government said trade negotiator Akazawa met with US Commerce Secretary Lutnick and Akazawa strongly sought a review of US tariffs. Elsewhere, Japan's former top FX diplomat says narrowing US-Japan rate gap will likely support the yen at around 135-140 against USD by year-end.GBP - GBP is softer vs. the broadly firmer USD with UK-specific newsflow on the light side ahead of next week's UK spending review. On which, UK Chancellor Reeves reaffirmed she will not have a UK budget like October's again, but can't rule out any tax changes over the next four years. For today's agenda, BoE Chief Economist Pill is due to speak @ 13:00BST, but given the subject matter of \"AI and Households\", it is unclear how much he will touch on monetary policy. After printing a multi-year high yesterday @ 1.3616, Cable has since retreated and moved back below the 1.3550 mark.Antipodeans - Antipodeans are steady vs. the USD following a light data docket and relevant newsflow overnight. Both continue to keep an eye on US-Sino relations following the Xi-Trump call yesterday given their trade exposure. However, the readout had little follow-through into either currency. AUD\/USD has moved back onto a 0.64 handle and pulled back from yesterday's YTD peak @ 0.6538. NZD\/USD has also retreated from yesterday's YTD high @ 0.6080 but is still holding above the 0.60 mark.NBP's Litwiniuk said they need to be cautious regarding the disinflation path; MPC can return to the subject of cuts in July or September; rates can still be cut by 100-125bps this year.TreasuriesUSTs - USTs are a touch higher ahead of the US jobs report and following yesterday's ECB-led losses which outmuscled a spike higher in weekly claims metrics. As it stands, the next 25bps cut is not fully priced until September with 54bps of loosening seen by year-end. Sep'25 USTs are currently within yesterday's 110.23+ to 111.14+ range. From a yield perspective, the US curve is fractionally in bull flattening mode, whilst the 10yr yield has moved back to the 4.37% after venturing as low as 4.318% yesterday.Bunds - Bunds are attempting to atone for yesterday's losses which were seen in the wake of the ECB rate decision. Sep'25 Bunds have been as high as 130.72 but are still some way away from yesterday's peak @ 131.47. The 10yr yield is back below the 2.55% mark after climbing as high as 2.581% yesterday.Gilts - Gilts are currently being led by the upside in German paper as UK-specific newsflow remains light ahead of next week's UK spending review. Sep'25 Gilts have been as high as 92.31 but still have some ground to cover before approaching yesterday's best @ 92.63. The 10yr yield currently sits just above the 4.6% mark and within yesterday's 4.557-4.648% range.CommoditiesCrude Futures - Subdued trade amid a firmer Dollar and overall cautious risk tone heading into the US jobs report before the weekend. Contracts saw a leg lower likely on technicals as WTI dipped under USD 63.00\/bbl at the same time as Brent fell under USD 65.00\/bbl, although prices thereafter stabilised. News flow has been light for the complex, with nothing major to report in geopolitics either.Precious Metals - Spot gold and silver are largely treading water amid a lack of catalysts during the European morning in the run-up to the US jobs report. Spot gold currently resides in a current USD 3,351.49-3,375.29\/oz range, well within yesterday's USD 3,338.29-3,403.15\/oz parameter.Base Metals - Mixed trade across base metals, in fitting with the cautious risk tone ahead of the US jobs report, with the Trump-Xi phone call doing little to keep broader prices underpinned during this session. 3M LME copper dipped back under USD 9,700\/t to trade in a USD 9,659.00-9,768.00\/t range at the time of writing. Dalian iron ore futures rose to a one-week peak overnight with traders citing strong Chinese demand coupled with some optimism following the Trump-Xi call, with the front-month contract ending daytime trade +0.9%.HSBC expects OPEC+ to accelerate supply hikes in August and September; weaker fundamentals after the summer, raise downside risks to the Bank's USD 65\/bbl brent forecast from Q425.LME has intervened to make Mercuria roll its \"huge\" position in aluminium, according to Bloomberg.India's Mines Minister said exploring critical mineral assets in Australia, Argentina and Chile.EU Ags Commissioner said EU-Ukraine trade has reverted to conditions of pre-war trade deal, after the expiry of wartime exemptions; could conclude a longer-term trade arrangement by summer.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

        "description":"US Equity Futures Unchanged Ahead Of ECB As Jobs Data Looms US equity futures are unchanged, as they struggle for direction ahead of Friday\u2019s payrolls report, following a series of data releases that offered mixed signals on the health of the economy. As of 8:00am, S&P futures are flat, having traded on either side of the unchanged line during the overnight session and followed a slurry of weak macro data releases which saw Wednesday's gains erase and recover, with the S&P ultimately ending the day flat. Nasdaq 100 futs are down 0.1% with Mag 7 stocks mostly higher except for TSLA (-1.6%). Stocks and bonds in Europe gained ahead of the ECB's expected 8th consecutive interest rate cut. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries steadied as Wednesday\u2019s bond rally faded. The dollar reversed earlier losses even as gold surged to briefly top $3400. Commodities are mostly mixed with notable outperformance in silver (+3.1%). News flow since yesterday\u2019s close has been largely muted: headlines continue to focus on trade negotiation development, particularly implication on rare earth curbs (BBG and CNBC) and upcoming Trump-Xi call.In premarket trading, the Mag 7 stocks are mixed (Alphabet +1.3%, Amazon +0.7%, Meta +0.2%, Microsoft 0%, Tesla -2.6%, Nvidia -0.5%, Apple -0.3%). Broadcom shares rise 1% in premarket ahead of earnings due after the bell. Chewy shares (CHWY) are down 2.4% premarket after Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala cut the recommendation on the online retailer of pet products to hold from buy, writing that valuation appears \u201cprimed\u201d for a first-quarter beat and raise that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Dollar Tree Inc. shares (DLTR) are up 1.6% in premarket trading, after JPMorgan upgraded the discount retailer to overweight from neutral. Here are some other notable movers: Five Below (FIVE) gains 6% in premarket trading after the discount stores company reported first-quarter results that beat expectations and guided for net sales in the second quarter that are above estimates.Nebius shares (NBIS) gain 5.6% in US premarket trading after the AI infrastructure software provider is initiated with a buy rating at Arete Research, while peer CoreWeave declines 2% after getting new neutral rating.PVH shares (PVH) drop 7.9% in premarket trading after the Calvin Klein owner cut its full-year adjusted earnings guidance, and noted that the outlook reflects an estimated net negative impact in relation to tariffs placed on goods coming into the US.Planet Labs shares (PL) jump 20% in premarket trading after first-quarter revenue beat estimates. Analysts at Citizens said the satellite data provider had a \u201cstellar quarter\u201d and the stock remains an opportunity for long-term capital appreciation.Visa shares (V) rise 1% in premarket trading on Thursday as Mizuho Securities raises the stock to outperform from neutral, saying the cash-to-card runway in the US still has room to grow.The wild swings in stocks that were sparked by the Trump administration\u2019s tariff announcements in April \u2014 and subsequent rebound \u2014 have given way to more subdued daily moves in recent weeks. The US benchmark has remained largely flat since mid-May as traders assess the impact of the trade war on economic activity.Friday\u2019s jobs report is expected to show that growth in nonfarm payrolls slowed and the unemployment rate remained steady. While the figures would chime with Wednesday data that showed a contraction in US services and a deceleration in private hiring, separate data earlier in the week unexpectedly showed a fairly broad advance in US job openings.\u201cConsensus is for lower job creation,\u201d said Ulrich Urbahn, head of multi-asset strategy and research at Berenberg. \u201cI think there must be a big surprise to the downside for volatility to increase.\u201dSome investors are warning that the current period of relative market calm could once again give way to volatility, as uncertainty lingers over the outcome of trade negotiations between the US and its biggest trading partners \u2014 and the full economic impact remains unclear.\u201cOur bias remains to sell any rallies\u201d in US bonds, said Mohit Kumar, chief European strategist at Jefferies International. \u201cWe are concerned over the fiscal deficits and the willingness of the rest of the world to continue financing US fiscal deficits.\u201dThe European Central Bank is set to cut rates for an eighth time later on Thursday. Another reduction is expected in September, when trade talks with the US should have concluded and fresh forecasts will reveal the full implications of the tariffs. And speaking of Europe, the Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, rising for a third day ahead of a widely anticipated interest-rate cut by the European Central Bank. European stocks were on track for the highest close in more than two weeks. Technology, construction and health care stocks are leading gains while travel and retail provide a drag. Here are the biggest European movers:Bayer shares rise as much as 5.1% after Goldman Sachs upgrades the German chemicals and pharmaceutical company to buy from neutral, saying it sees earnings as having bottomed out and thinks risks around litigation and pharma data are overdone.Dr. Martens surges as much as 17%, the most since November, after the UK bootmaker releases its full-year results and outlines its new \u2018Levers For Growth\u2019 strategy update.Redcare shares rise as much as 2.3%, paring some of Wednesday\u2019s 14% drop that was spurred by a rating downgrade at Kepler Cheuvreux. Concerns about structural challenges related to the anticipated phaseout of the CardLink system are \u201cunwarranted and lack concrete support,\u201d according to Deutsche Bank analysts.Wise shares rise as much as 9% to a record high after the money-transfer firm said it intends to seek a primary listing in the US to enhance visibility to the investment community and the stock\u2019s trading.Burckhardt shares gain as much as 6%, to the highest level since February, with Vontobel analysts saying the Swiss compressors manufacturer delivered significant margin progress compared to last year, driven by a good product mix.Wizz Air shares fall as much as 27%, the steepest drop since the early days of the pandemic, after the airline\u2019s cost guidance and fourth-quarter results disappointed analysts.CMC Markets shares tank as much as 18% after reporting annual pretax profit below expectations after disappointing investors on costs, according to analysts at Shore Capital, while the dividend was also lower than hoped.Akzo Nobel falls as much as 2.5% as UBS cuts the recommendation on the coatings and Dulux paint maker to neutral from buy.Avolta shares drop as much as 7.9% after one of its investors sold shares at a discount to Wednesday\u2019s close.Hemnet falls as much as 8.4% to its lowest since Jan. 31 after Nordea double-downgraded its view on the Swedish real estate listings platform to sell from buy, saying recent monetization pushes for premium offerings \u201cmay have crossed a line where user price elasticity begins to invite disruption.\u201dEarlier in the session, Asian stocks edged higher, as South Korean shares extended a rally on hopes of improved corporate governance under the new president. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 0.4%, heading for its highest level in more than three years. Korea\u2019s Kospi Index jumped 1.5% after the ruling party said it will propose a revision to Commercial Act again, a key step in improving corporate governance. Benchmarks in Hong Kong and Taiwan also gained, with US economic data starting to soften and supporting the case for an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Japanese shares fell. Demand at the country\u2019s 30-year bond auction was weaker than the average over the past year. The regional benchmark\u2019s gain in recent weeks is in tandem with global peers, which closed at a record high Wednesday on expectations that the worst of higher tariffs may be over. Still, uncertainty remains high around the progress of US-China trade talks, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping making clear that a phone call doesn\u2019t come without a price. That\u2019s even as Trump is seeking a personal discussion with Beijing to prevent further escalation in trade tensions.In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is unchanged. The Japanese yen is the weakest of the G-10 currencies, falling 0.3% against the greenback. The kiwi tops the leader board with a 0.4% gain. The euro traded steady after advancing more than 10% against the dollar year-to-date.In rates, treasuries are mixed with gains only seen at the longer end of the curve. US 30-year yields fall 2 bps to 4.86%. European government bonds advance across all maturities, with UK and German 10-year yields falling 3-4 bps each. Japanese government bonds rose after an auction of 30-year debt was better than many investors had feared. Still, a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.92 at the offering pointed to a general lack of appetite for longer-maturity debt.MarketsIn commodities, oil prices are steady with WTI near $63 a barrel. Spot gold rises $12 to around $3,385\/oz. Silver rises 3% and above $35\/oz for the time since 2012.Looking to the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hear from the Fed\u2019s Kugler, Harker and Schmid, BoE Deputy Governor Breeden, and the BoE\u2019s Greene. Data releases from the UK include the weekly initial jobless claims and the April trade balance.

Furthermore, President Trump signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University.Wall Street\u2019s top regulator took a step toward toughening rules for foreign companies listed on American stock markets on Wednesday, saying many Chinese firms in particular unduly benefited from having to make fewer regular disclosures to investors. The regulator warned that foreign firms, especially ones from China, could face stricter disclosure rules. SCMPUS business optimism moved sharply lower, with only 27% of executives polled in May by the AICPA confident about the economic outlook for the 12 months ahead. BBGA private gauge of China\u2019s services sector signaled that activity picked up in May, despite a renewed fall in new export orders.

So investors became a lot more confident that the Fed would still cut rates this year, and the 10yr Treasury yield fell -10.0bps on the day to 4.36%. That decline in yields had the double benefit of easing financial conditions, whilst also relaxing fears about the fiscal situation. So equities held up despite the underwhelming data, with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly reaching a 3-month high. Indeed, the index is now up +19.83% since its closing low after Liberation Day, leaving it just shy of the 20% mark that would mark the technical start of a bull market.Of course, even with the rally, the data still raised fears that the US economy lost steam into May. That started off with the ADP\u2019s report of private payrolls, which was the softest in over two years, at just +37k (vs. +114k expected). And shortly after that, we had the ISM services index, which fell to 49.9 (vs. 52.0 expected), and the details from the report weren\u2019t great either. For instance, the new orders component slumped to a two-year low of 46.4, whilst the prices paid indicator surged to 68.7, the highest since 2022. Nevertheless, investors weren\u2019t too alarmed by these data prints, as the numbers weren\u2019t so bad as to revive fears about a recession. Indeed, it\u2019s worth noting that the ISM services index had a big move lower back in December 2022, at a time when the Fed were aggressively hiking rates, which was then followed up by a strong recovery the following month. So in general, investors were reluctant to over-interpret one day\u2019s data, not least given the big test is coming tomorrow with the US jobs report. Moreover, there was a more positive signal from the final US composite PMI for May, which was revised up from the flash reading to 53.0. In terms of the market reaction, both the ADP and the ISM services prints led investors to price in more rate cuts this year, with clear moves in response to the two prints. In fact by the close, futures were pricing in 58bps of rate cuts by the Fed\u2019s December meeting, up +8.0bps on the day, and the highest number in over three weeks. And there\u2019s growing confidence that we\u2019ll see the first rate cut by September, with futures now almost fully pricing (97%) one by that meeting. Given the additional rate cuts being priced, that triggered a major surge for US Treasuries yesterday. So at the front end, the 2yr yield was down -8.5bps on the day to 3.87%. And for the 30yr yield, the -10.3bps move was actually the biggest daily decline since February, pushing the yield down to 4.88%. Only a small amount of that rally has unwound this morning, with the 10yr yield up +0.6bps, and the 30yr yield up +0.5bps.The large slide in Treasury yields had the added benefit of reassuring investors about the fiscal situation, which had been in growing focus as the 30yr yield hovered around the 5% mark. So even with the weak economic data, risk assets held up reasonably well with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly posting a 3-month high in a session that saw the lowest daily trading range for the index since mid-February. The S&P 500 now stands just -2.82% beneath its all-time high in February, although futures this morning aren\u2019t suggesting much momentum, with those on the S&P 500 down -0.05%.Meanwhile in Europe, there were consistent gains, with the STOXX 600 (+0.47%) advancing for a second day. There was some support from the final PMI numbers, with the Euro Area composite revised up from the flash reading to 50.2 (vs. flash 49.5). So that meant it was no longer beneath the 50-mark pointing towards a contraction. Over in Germany, the DAX (+0.77%) even hit a fresh record, which came as the cabinet approved a new package of corporate tax breaks. For sovereign bonds, there was a steadier performance across the continent, with yields on 10yr bunds (+0.1bps), OATs (+1.3bps) and BTPs (-0.3bps) seeing modest movements. Yesterday also brought headlines in the geopolitical sphere, although markets weren\u2019t too reactive to the various stories. Before the European open, President Trump said that President Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d So that led to a very modest slide in US equity futures. Meanwhile, Trump also posted about a conversation with Russian President Putin, which he said was \u201cnot a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.\u201d Otherwise on the trade front, there were positive noises from the US-EU trade negotiations. EU trade commissioner Maros\u030c S\u030cefc\u030covic\u030c tweeted that \u201cWe\u2019re advancing in the right direction at pace \u2013 and staying in close contact to maintain the momentum.\u201d Similarly, US trade representative Jamieson Greer said that \u201cI am pleased that negotiations are advancing quickly\u201d. Overnight in Asia we\u2019ve seen a pretty mixed performance from the major equity indices. In Japan, the Nikkei is down -0.46%, which follows a weak auction of 30yr debt, where there was the weakest demand since 2023. However, bond markets haven\u2019t reacted badly, with the 30yr yield coming down -6.6bps this morning. By contrast, South Korea\u2019s KOSPI (+1.05%) has built on yesterday\u2019s +2.66% gain, with the index currently on track to close at its highest level since mid-July. Otherwise, the Hang Seng (+0.42%) is on track for a third consecutive advance, whilst the CSI 300 (+0.07%) and the Shanghai Comp (+0.08%) have also posted modest gains this morning. Looking forward, central banks will be in the spotlight today, as the ECB are announcing their latest policy decision at 13:15 London time. It\u2019s widely expected that they\u2019ll deliver another 25bp rate cut, taking their deposit rate down to 2%. However, after a succession of consecutive cuts, there\u2019s more doubt on what happens after this meeting into year-end, as this cut would take them broadly into the middle of the neutral range. In their preview (link here), our European economists expect the ECB to keep the meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to setting policy. However, they think getting the hawks to support a June cut might require a hint of conditional patience, including an implicit willingness to pause at the next meeting in July and wait until September. Staying on central banks, the Bank of Canada left their policy rate on hold at 2.75% yesterday, in line with expectations. Afterwards, Governor Macklem said \u201cthere was a clear consensus to hold policy unchanged as we gain more information\u201d. And in future, he said \u201cmembers thought there could be a need for a reduction in the policy rate if the economy weakens in the face of continued US tariffs and uncertainty, and cost pressures on inflation are contained.\u201d By the close, the Canadian dollar had strengthened +0.31% against the US Dollar to its strongest level since early October. However, that was mainly a function of US dollar weakness, with the US Dollar weakening against every other G10 currency yesterday after the weaker US data.To the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hear from the Fed\u2019s Kugler, Harker and Schmid, BoE Deputy Governor Breeden, and the BoE\u2019s Greene. Data releases from the UK include the weekly initial jobless claims and the April trade balance. Meanwhile in Europe, there\u2019s German factory orders for April, and the May construction PMIs for Germany and the UK. Tyler DurdenThu, 06\/05\/2025 - 08:15",

        "title":"ECB Preview: 8th Rate Cut In A Row",
        "description":"ECB Preview: 8th Rate Cut In A Row As UBS economist Paul Donovan writes this morning, a total of 52 out of 52 surveyed economists - not to mention markets - expect a quarter point ECB rate reduction today, the 8th in a row, adding rhetorically \"How could so many economists possibly be wrong?\" More to the point, he adds that President Trump is likely to become even more irate after criticizing the Federal Reserve for not cutting rates. Rhetorical questions aside, here is what to expected, courtesy of NewsquawkOVERVIEW: Given the uncertainties surrounding the trade outlook and progress on the inflation front, the ECB is expected to cut the deposit Rate by 25bps to 2.00%. With a rate reduction nailed on, focus will be on any hints over future easing plans. While Lagarde might not make any explicit mention of the future policy direction, any signs of dissent, whether via remarks by the President or sources after the meeting, could provide a guiding star for markets. Currently, markets see a total of 54bps of loosening by year-end (including the expected June cut).PRIOR MEETING: April\u02bcs meeting saw a 25bps cut as expected and the old language around restrictiveness was removed. This took the ECB to the top end of its 1.75-2.25% neutral rate estimate. Accompanying forward guidance was unsurprisingly non-committal, though the statement did highlight increased uncertainty and an associated confidence impact that is \u201clikely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions\u201d; on this, participants were attentive to any hints around an offsetting policy response (i.e. dovish action). Just after the meeting, sources reported the decision to cut was unanimous. Lagarde didn\u02bct add too much, aside from stressing no argument was made for 50bps or other stimulus, though she made the point that they are viewing tariffs as a demand shock.RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS : Flash inflation data for May saw Y\/Y HICP decline to 1.9% from 2.2% (below target for the first time since September 2024). Core inflation declined to 2.4% from 2.7%, whilst services inflation saw a notable fall to 3.7% from 4.0%. The ECB Consumer Expectations Survey for April saw the 12-month ahead metric rise to 3.1% from 2.9%. In terms of market gauges, the EZ 5y5y inflation forward has ticked higher to 2.06% vs. circa 2.03% at the time of the prior meeting. On the growth front, Q1 GDP is currently estimated at 0.3% Q\/Q vs. the Q4 print of 0.2%. More timely survey data from S&P Global showed manufacturing PMI for May climbed to 49.4 from 49.0, services slipped to 48.9 from 50.1, leaving the composite at 49.5 vs. prev. 50.4. The accompanying release noted \u201cthe eurozone economy just cannot seem to find its footing\u201d. The unemployment rate remains at the historic low of 6.2%.RECENT COMMUNICATIONS: Since the prior meeting, President Lagarde has remarked that levies are probably more disinflationary than inflationary. However, the net effect of tariffs is still uncertain. Chief Economist Lane is confident that the Bank\u02bcs task to bring inflation back to 2% is \u201cmostly completed\u201d, however, services inflation is \"still too high\". The influential Schnabel of Germany is of the view that tariffs could be disinflationary in the short run but result in upside risk over the medium term. France's Villeroy has stated that interest rate normalisation within the EZ is probably incomplete. Typically-dovish, Panetta of Italy has remarked that there is reduced room to cut rates further, though the macro outlook is weak and trade tensions could weigh on this. Elsewhere, Cyprus' Patsalides has noted that a 50bp cut would only be justified if recession risks intensified with stronger disinflation. At the hawkish end of the spectrum, Austria\u02bcs Holzmann thinks the Bank should not lower rates in June or July.RATES: Consensus looks for the ECB to cut rates by 25bps with markets assigning a 95% chance of such an outcome. Since the prior meeting, whilst there has been an easing of tensions between the US and China, which led to an improvement in the global trade outlook, a deal between the EU and the US remains elusive. The lack of progress prompted US President Trump to recommend a 50% tariff on the EU as of June 1st. This threat has since been pushed back to July 9th and the EU is increasing efforts to get an agreement. However, large gaps between the two sides remain and the growth outlook remains uncertain. Furthermore, as detailed above, progress on the inflation front means that policymakers have the green light to ease policy (also aided by the stronger EUR and declining oil prices). Assuming the ECB cuts by 25bps this week, the focus will be on any clues as to what comes thereafter, given the apparent split of views on the GC. The accounts of the ECB meeting (albeit when trade tensions were higher) showed that some members would have been comfortable with a 50bps reduction. Some of the more hawkish members on the GC may opt to dissent to the decision with Holzmann of the view that the ECB should not cut rates in June or July. Currently, markets see a total of 54bps of loosening by year-end (including the expected June cut).MACRO PROJECTIONS: For the accompanying macro projections, Rabobank expects growth to be revised down a touch for both 2025 and 2026 while the inflation view is likely to be trimmed for 2025 to 2.0% (Mar. 2.3%) but increased for 2026 to 2.3% (Mar. 2.0%).HICP INFLATION: 2025: 2.3%2026: 1.9%2027: 2.0%HICP CORE INFLATION (EX-ENERGY & FOOD): 2025: 2.2%2026: 2.0%2027: 1.9%GDP: 2025: 0.9%2026: 1.2%2027: 1.3% Tyler DurdenThu, 06\/05\/2025 - 07:45",

        "title":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall",
        "description":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall India's central bank shocked markets this morning when it slashing interest rates (in a 5:1 vote) by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row - and the largest rate cut since the covid crash, amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy. It also spiked the amount of liquidity available in the system to kickstart moribund lending. The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years, following two previous 25bps reductions in April and February.Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is \"lower than our aspirations\" and the bank felt it was \"imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment\" amid rising global uncertainties.Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The world's (newly) most populous country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices.RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. Inflation for Fiscal Year 2026 has been revised down to 3.7% from 4%, with Q1 (April- June) projected at just 2.9%. Growth forecast remains unchanged at 6.5%. This growth is well below the 8% growth the RBI aspires for.There was another big surprise in today's announcement: alongside the greater than expected cut, the central bank changed its monetary policy stance from \"accommodative\" to \"neutral\", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves, a move which was viewed as hawkish, and sparking a sharp curve steepening. The change in stance suggests the bar for further rate cuts is now higher. As the RBI noted, after 100bps of cuts since February, policy space is now limited.However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low.The RBI also unexpectedly cut the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) rate starting September 2025 , which is set to release INR2.5tn into the banking system. With liquidity already in surplus, overnight rates may now move closer to the SDF, 25bps below the repo rate.Credit growth remains weak at 9.8% YoY (vs 19.5% a year ago). The CRR cut, to be implemented in four 25bps tranches starting September, aims to improve credit transmission. The Governor noted that announcing the schedule in advance is meant to reassure banks of the RBI\u2019s commitment to supporting liquiditySome more details from Goldman Sachs:Policy rate - lowered by 50bp with a 5:1 vote: The RBI MPC voted 5:1 to lower the policy repo rate by 50bp to 5.50% at the June meeting, vs. an expectation of a 25bp repo rate cut. External Member Bhattacharya voted for a 25bp repo rate cut. Consequently, both the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate were lowered by 50bp each to 5.75% and 5.25%, respectively.Policy stance changed to 'neutral': The MPC changed its policy stance back to 'neutral' from 'accommodative'. The Governor clarified that \"after having reduced the policy repo rate by 100 bps in quick succession since February 2025, under the current circumstances, monetary policy is left with very limited space to support growth\". We interpret this as the end of the current rate easing cycle with repo rate at 5.50% -- implying ~1% real policy rate on a one-year forward inflation forecast. The RBI may not want the ex-ante real rate below 1%, in our view, especially when the growth outlook is balanced. We had been forecasting a 5.50% repo rate marking the end of the cycle, with 25bp rate cuts each in June and August meetings, but the RBI got there a meeting faster than we expected.Growth forecast retained at 6.5% yoy for FY26: The RBI retained their growth forecast at 6.5% yoy for FY26 (GSe: 6.2% yoy), noting strong agricultural sector growth and rural demand, and a resilient services sector underpinning a recovery in urban demand. However, the Governor highlighted downside risks to growth from US \"reciprocal\" tariff-related uncertainty and prolonged geopolitical tensions.Inflation forecast lowered by 30bp to 3.7% yoy for FY26: The RBI lowered its inflation forecast by 30bp to 3.7% yoy (GSe: 3.6% yoy) (Exhibit 1). The Governor highlighted that there is \u201cgreater confidence of headline inflation remaining below the target of 4% over the course of the year\u201d. Food inflation is likely to remain benign given higher wheat and pulses (legumes) production. Additionally, Indian Meteorological Department\u2019s expectations of an above-normal monsoon bode well for the production of summer crops. However, the Governor also highlighted upside risks to the inflation outlook from weather and US \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff-related uncertainty.Banking system liquidity: The RBI announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 100bp to 3.0% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in four tranches from September to November to ease banking system liquidity further. As per the RBI\u2019s estimate, this measure is expected to release durable liquidity of INR 2.5tn (0.7% of GDP) into the banking system.The Governor said that the RBI \u201cremains committed to provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system\". With durable liquidity already in surplus in recent months, overnight rates have traded on an average ~20bp below the repo rate from April to June (Exhibit 2), resulting in a significant easing in financial conditions. As a result, overnight rates have come off by more than 150bp from mid-January to now.India's lower borrowing costs will have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector.\"This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,\" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.Predictably, Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement. Looking ahead, Goldman expects the RBI to stay on hold for the rest of the year unless growth slows sharply. The front end of the IGB curve should remain supported by strong liquidity and favorable demand-supply dynamics. The bank favors 2Y IGB and expect the IGB curve to steepen.

        "title":"Highs And Lows",
        "description":"Highs And Lows By Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at RabobankHighs and LowsBond yields were up some 5 basis points globally whilst the euro made a slight reversal after having pushed for a near high of 1.15 as the ECB concluded its press conference. From a \u2018low\u2019 inspired by 50% tariffs on US steel and aluminium imports going \u2018live\u2019 earlier this week and growing concerns about the US economy and the labor market, sentiment in financial markets briefly swung back to a \u2018high\u2019 as President Donald Trump said he had a \u201cvery good phone call\u201d with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Gains in equity markets were modest but still good enough for S&P500 to extend its rally to 20% from its 8 April low. That is, before the falling-out between Trump and Musk reached a boiling point on social media. Enough is being written about that right now, so we\u2019ll leave you at it.After the call with Xi, Trump said that both leaders have agreed to further talks and that there \u201cshould no longer be any questions respectively the complexity of Rare Earth products\u201d. That\u2019s up for various interpretations, but it suggests China has offered to speed up its process of lifting its export restrictions. Still, the Chinese readout of the call, unsurprisingly, was more nuanced and said that Xi had urged Trump to remove \u201cnegative\u201d measures that have affected trade between the countries in recent months. The upshot, from the market\u2019s perspective is that both sides are, at least, talking and that holds the prospect of further progress in removing some (still very high) tariffs. But, just for balance, Commerce Secretary Lutnick yesterday called for increased enforcement of US export controls on technology, warning that China was \u201conly attacking great American companies.\u201d If President Xi was referring to those export controls with \u201cnegative measures\u201d, the market\u2019s positive assessment may be, well, too high.That further talks with the US can lead to a \u2018deal\u2019 (as Keir Starmer can confirm), a stalemate (see EU-US) or a major escalation, as Zelensky can attest, is on any global leader\u2019s mind. Nikkei Asia reports that US negotiators Bessent, Lutnick and Greer keep Japan guessing. \u201cAt one point the three cabinet officials put the talks with the Japanese side on hold an began debating right in front of them\u201d, a source tells the Nikkei. In that sense, German Chancellor Merz came away nicely after a 40-minute meeting in the Oval Office, as he let Trump do most of the talking. Little concrete came from that meeting, though Trump acknowledged the ramp-up in German defense spending.Trade data are going from lows to highs as well, which in some cases makes the Covid-episode data look pale. As the Commerce Department confirmed, the US trade deficit for April shrunk by the most on record, to $61.6bn from $138.3bn in March, driven by the largest-ever decline in imports.Frontloading in the run-up the tariffs clearly was massive and then collapsed. This also suggests that after its big negative contribution to US GDP growth in Q1 it will be a significant positive factor in Q2. Inventory effects will likely attenuate some of its effect. Bloomberg noted that a drop in imports of pharmaceuticals from Ireland was responsible for an almost $20bn swing in the deficit. The opposite (statistical) effect is thus going to be seen in Europe in Q2. Ireland yesterday reported a significant upward revision in Q1 GDP (which now points to a revision in Eurozone GDP growth to around +0.6% q\/q (!) from 0.3% previously). But this will obviously turn to a significant drag in Q2 as those US trade numbers for April just signaled.Staying in Europe, the ECB seemingly presented itself as an anchor of stability in these times of highs and lows. Lagarde\u2019s new mantra is now \u201cwell positioned\u201d, which could be viewed in our opinion as code language for \u201cwe\u2019re done cutting, unless...\u201d. This becomes even clearer when you compare it to the previous mantra Lagarde introduced in March when she called ECB policy \u201cmeaningfully less restrictive\u201d. We had expected little to no guidance from yesterday\u2019s policy meeting, but these new words \u2013 despite lower oil prices and a stronger euro \u2013 lead us to maintain our view that we have reached the terminal rate.However, the ECB leaves ample room to respond if things do not work out the way they envisage. Indeed, it lowered its inflation forecast significantly with core inflation positioned around 2% for the coming years. Moreover, its new scenario analyses unveiled a dovish reaction function to a potential escalation of trade tensions. Should this happen, and paused tariffs were to be reinstated, the ECB\u2019s economists estimate that this could lower GDP growth through 2027 by about 1% cumulatively. And, interestingly, they conclude that inflation would be somewhat lower as well: in such a scenario inflation would average 1.8% in 2027, and that includes the assumption that the EU retaliates. By contrast, our own econometric analysis indicates that European tariffs on the US would be (mildly) inflationary instead.Lagarde did say that their modelling exercise assumed that higher tariffs could lead to lower demand for euro area exports and to countries with overcapacity rerouting their exports to the euro area thereby putting more downward pressure on inflation. However, she acknowledged that the ECB\u2019s analysis did not include any inflationary impact from a disruption of supply chains. Although this effect, admittedly, is surrounded by even more uncertainty, we did take this into account in our own scenario analysis (which explains why we still have inflation somewhat above the ECB\u2019s target even in 2026). And one only need to take a quick glance at container freight rates (benchmark composite by WCI up by a staggering 175% compared to last month) to understand why be believe the ECB the ECB could be under-estimating the potential highs.Time will tell, of course. But one thing that the ECB may be right about, is the (initial) downward pressure on imported goods prices due to a diversion of trade. The European Commission yesterday published its first assessment from its trade diversion monitoring tool that was launched in April. The early warning system tracks shipments and prices of goods at a high level of detail. In the short-run lower prices may benefit European importers and thereby consumers, but if those prices are the result of overcapacity in other parts of the world (such as China) this could also undermine European producers. The South China Morning Post reported that \u201cin the month to May 25, imports of light-emitting diodes surged 156 per cent, while their price fell 65 per cent. Shipments of industrial robots shot up by 315 per cent, paired with a 35 per cent price decline. And imports of some bars and rods made from steel alloy soared by over 1,000 per cent as their price plunged 86 per cent.\u201dWhilst such figures can be extremely volatile due to their level of detail, seasonal patterns etc. and make no distinction between the origin of the content, a heatmap by the Commission shows that China was a significant contributor to these changes. The FT writes that the surge in steel imports, driven by trade diversion, is setting off alarm bells in the steel sector. Forecasting the next steps by the European Commission is a rather speculative affair, but we\u2019d not be surprised if this leads to some form of action. This year the Commission has already launched more than 10 cases against China and\/or Chinese producers (based on our count of news articles on the EU\u2019s trade defense website).

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

        "title":"ECB Preview: 8th Rate Cut In A Row",
        "description":"ECB Preview: 8th Rate Cut In A Row As UBS economist Paul Donovan writes this morning, a total of 52 out of 52 surveyed economists - not to mention markets - expect a quarter point ECB rate reduction today, the 8th in a row, adding rhetorically \"How could so many economists possibly be wrong?\" More to the point, he adds that President Trump is likely to become even more irate after criticizing the Federal Reserve for not cutting rates. Rhetorical questions aside, here is what to expected, courtesy of NewsquawkOVERVIEW: Given the uncertainties surrounding the trade outlook and progress on the inflation front, the ECB is expected to cut the deposit Rate by 25bps to 2.00%. With a rate reduction nailed on, focus will be on any hints over future easing plans. While Lagarde might not make any explicit mention of the future policy direction, any signs of dissent, whether via remarks by the President or sources after the meeting, could provide a guiding star for markets. Currently, markets see a total of 54bps of loosening by year-end (including the expected June cut).PRIOR MEETING: April\u02bcs meeting saw a 25bps cut as expected and the old language around restrictiveness was removed. This took the ECB to the top end of its 1.75-2.25% neutral rate estimate. Accompanying forward guidance was unsurprisingly non-committal, though the statement did highlight increased uncertainty and an associated confidence impact that is \u201clikely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions\u201d; on this, participants were attentive to any hints around an offsetting policy response (i.e. dovish action). Just after the meeting, sources reported the decision to cut was unanimous. Lagarde didn\u02bct add too much, aside from stressing no argument was made for 50bps or other stimulus, though she made the point that they are viewing tariffs as a demand shock.RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS : Flash inflation data for May saw Y\/Y HICP decline to 1.9% from 2.2% (below target for the first time since September 2024). Core inflation declined to 2.4% from 2.7%, whilst services inflation saw a notable fall to 3.7% from 4.0%. The ECB Consumer Expectations Survey for April saw the 12-month ahead metric rise to 3.1% from 2.9%. In terms of market gauges, the EZ 5y5y inflation forward has ticked higher to 2.06% vs. circa 2.03% at the time of the prior meeting. On the growth front, Q1 GDP is currently estimated at 0.3% Q\/Q vs. the Q4 print of 0.2%. More timely survey data from S&P Global showed manufacturing PMI for May climbed to 49.4 from 49.0, services slipped to 48.9 from 50.1, leaving the composite at 49.5 vs. prev. 50.4. The accompanying release noted \u201cthe eurozone economy just cannot seem to find its footing\u201d. The unemployment rate remains at the historic low of 6.2%.RECENT COMMUNICATIONS: Since the prior meeting, President Lagarde has remarked that levies are probably more disinflationary than inflationary. However, the net effect of tariffs is still uncertain. Chief Economist Lane is confident that the Bank\u02bcs task to bring inflation back to 2% is \u201cmostly completed\u201d, however, services inflation is \"still too high\". The influential Schnabel of Germany is of the view that tariffs could be disinflationary in the short run but result in upside risk over the medium term. France's Villeroy has stated that interest rate normalisation within the EZ is probably incomplete. Typically-dovish, Panetta of Italy has remarked that there is reduced room to cut rates further, though the macro outlook is weak and trade tensions could weigh on this. Elsewhere, Cyprus' Patsalides has noted that a 50bp cut would only be justified if recession risks intensified with stronger disinflation. At the hawkish end of the spectrum, Austria\u02bcs Holzmann thinks the Bank should not lower rates in June or July.RATES: Consensus looks for the ECB to cut rates by 25bps with markets assigning a 95% chance of such an outcome. Since the prior meeting, whilst there has been an easing of tensions between the US and China, which led to an improvement in the global trade outlook, a deal between the EU and the US remains elusive. The lack of progress prompted US President Trump to recommend a 50% tariff on the EU as of June 1st. This threat has since been pushed back to July 9th and the EU is increasing efforts to get an agreement. However, large gaps between the two sides remain and the growth outlook remains uncertain. Furthermore, as detailed above, progress on the inflation front means that policymakers have the green light to ease policy (also aided by the stronger EUR and declining oil prices). Assuming the ECB cuts by 25bps this week, the focus will be on any clues as to what comes thereafter, given the apparent split of views on the GC. The accounts of the ECB meeting (albeit when trade tensions were higher) showed that some members would have been comfortable with a 50bps reduction. Some of the more hawkish members on the GC may opt to dissent to the decision with Holzmann of the view that the ECB should not cut rates in June or July. Currently, markets see a total of 54bps of loosening by year-end (including the expected June cut).MACRO PROJECTIONS: For the accompanying macro projections, Rabobank expects growth to be revised down a touch for both 2025 and 2026 while the inflation view is likely to be trimmed for 2025 to 2.0% (Mar. 2.3%) but increased for 2026 to 2.3% (Mar. 2.0%).HICP INFLATION: 2025: 2.3%2026: 1.9%2027: 2.0%HICP CORE INFLATION (EX-ENERGY & FOOD): 2025: 2.2%2026: 2.0%2027: 1.9%GDP: 2025: 0.9%2026: 1.2%2027: 1.3% Tyler DurdenThu, 06\/05\/2025 - 07:45",

        "title":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall",
        "description":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall India's central bank shocked markets this morning when it slashing interest rates (in a 5:1 vote) by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row - and the largest rate cut since the covid crash, amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy. It also spiked the amount of liquidity available in the system to kickstart moribund lending. The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years, following two previous 25bps reductions in April and February.Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is \"lower than our aspirations\" and the bank felt it was \"imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment\" amid rising global uncertainties.Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The world's (newly) most populous country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices.RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. Inflation for Fiscal Year 2026 has been revised down to 3.7% from 4%, with Q1 (April- June) projected at just 2.9%. Growth forecast remains unchanged at 6.5%. This growth is well below the 8% growth the RBI aspires for.There was another big surprise in today's announcement: alongside the greater than expected cut, the central bank changed its monetary policy stance from \"accommodative\" to \"neutral\", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves, a move which was viewed as hawkish, and sparking a sharp curve steepening. The change in stance suggests the bar for further rate cuts is now higher. As the RBI noted, after 100bps of cuts since February, policy space is now limited.However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low.The RBI also unexpectedly cut the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) rate starting September 2025 , which is set to release INR2.5tn into the banking system. With liquidity already in surplus, overnight rates may now move closer to the SDF, 25bps below the repo rate.Credit growth remains weak at 9.8% YoY (vs 19.5% a year ago). The CRR cut, to be implemented in four 25bps tranches starting September, aims to improve credit transmission. The Governor noted that announcing the schedule in advance is meant to reassure banks of the RBI\u2019s commitment to supporting liquiditySome more details from Goldman Sachs:Policy rate - lowered by 50bp with a 5:1 vote: The RBI MPC voted 5:1 to lower the policy repo rate by 50bp to 5.50% at the June meeting, vs. an expectation of a 25bp repo rate cut. External Member Bhattacharya voted for a 25bp repo rate cut. Consequently, both the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate were lowered by 50bp each to 5.75% and 5.25%, respectively.Policy stance changed to 'neutral': The MPC changed its policy stance back to 'neutral' from 'accommodative'. The Governor clarified that \"after having reduced the policy repo rate by 100 bps in quick succession since February 2025, under the current circumstances, monetary policy is left with very limited space to support growth\". We interpret this as the end of the current rate easing cycle with repo rate at 5.50% -- implying ~1% real policy rate on a one-year forward inflation forecast. The RBI may not want the ex-ante real rate below 1%, in our view, especially when the growth outlook is balanced. We had been forecasting a 5.50% repo rate marking the end of the cycle, with 25bp rate cuts each in June and August meetings, but the RBI got there a meeting faster than we expected.Growth forecast retained at 6.5% yoy for FY26: The RBI retained their growth forecast at 6.5% yoy for FY26 (GSe: 6.2% yoy), noting strong agricultural sector growth and rural demand, and a resilient services sector underpinning a recovery in urban demand. However, the Governor highlighted downside risks to growth from US \"reciprocal\" tariff-related uncertainty and prolonged geopolitical tensions.Inflation forecast lowered by 30bp to 3.7% yoy for FY26: The RBI lowered its inflation forecast by 30bp to 3.7% yoy (GSe: 3.6% yoy) (Exhibit 1). The Governor highlighted that there is \u201cgreater confidence of headline inflation remaining below the target of 4% over the course of the year\u201d. Food inflation is likely to remain benign given higher wheat and pulses (legumes) production. Additionally, Indian Meteorological Department\u2019s expectations of an above-normal monsoon bode well for the production of summer crops. However, the Governor also highlighted upside risks to the inflation outlook from weather and US \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff-related uncertainty.Banking system liquidity: The RBI announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 100bp to 3.0% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in four tranches from September to November to ease banking system liquidity further. As per the RBI\u2019s estimate, this measure is expected to release durable liquidity of INR 2.5tn (0.7% of GDP) into the banking system.The Governor said that the RBI \u201cremains committed to provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system\". With durable liquidity already in surplus in recent months, overnight rates have traded on an average ~20bp below the repo rate from April to June (Exhibit 2), resulting in a significant easing in financial conditions. As a result, overnight rates have come off by more than 150bp from mid-January to now.India's lower borrowing costs will have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector.\"This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,\" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.Predictably, Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement. Looking ahead, Goldman expects the RBI to stay on hold for the rest of the year unless growth slows sharply. The front end of the IGB curve should remain supported by strong liquidity and favorable demand-supply dynamics. The bank favors 2Y IGB and expect the IGB curve to steepen.

        "title":"Highs And Lows",
        "description":"Highs And Lows By Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at RabobankHighs and LowsBond yields were up some 5 basis points globally whilst the euro made a slight reversal after having pushed for a near high of 1.15 as the ECB concluded its press conference. From a \u2018low\u2019 inspired by 50% tariffs on US steel and aluminium imports going \u2018live\u2019 earlier this week and growing concerns about the US economy and the labor market, sentiment in financial markets briefly swung back to a \u2018high\u2019 as President Donald Trump said he had a \u201cvery good phone call\u201d with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Gains in equity markets were modest but still good enough for S&P500 to extend its rally to 20% from its 8 April low. That is, before the falling-out between Trump and Musk reached a boiling point on social media. Enough is being written about that right now, so we\u2019ll leave you at it.After the call with Xi, Trump said that both leaders have agreed to further talks and that there \u201cshould no longer be any questions respectively the complexity of Rare Earth products\u201d. That\u2019s up for various interpretations, but it suggests China has offered to speed up its process of lifting its export restrictions. Still, the Chinese readout of the call, unsurprisingly, was more nuanced and said that Xi had urged Trump to remove \u201cnegative\u201d measures that have affected trade between the countries in recent months. The upshot, from the market\u2019s perspective is that both sides are, at least, talking and that holds the prospect of further progress in removing some (still very high) tariffs. But, just for balance, Commerce Secretary Lutnick yesterday called for increased enforcement of US export controls on technology, warning that China was \u201conly attacking great American companies.\u201d If President Xi was referring to those export controls with \u201cnegative measures\u201d, the market\u2019s positive assessment may be, well, too high.That further talks with the US can lead to a \u2018deal\u2019 (as Keir Starmer can confirm), a stalemate (see EU-US) or a major escalation, as Zelensky can attest, is on any global leader\u2019s mind. Nikkei Asia reports that US negotiators Bessent, Lutnick and Greer keep Japan guessing. \u201cAt one point the three cabinet officials put the talks with the Japanese side on hold an began debating right in front of them\u201d, a source tells the Nikkei. In that sense, German Chancellor Merz came away nicely after a 40-minute meeting in the Oval Office, as he let Trump do most of the talking. Little concrete came from that meeting, though Trump acknowledged the ramp-up in German defense spending.Trade data are going from lows to highs as well, which in some cases makes the Covid-episode data look pale. As the Commerce Department confirmed, the US trade deficit for April shrunk by the most on record, to $61.6bn from $138.3bn in March, driven by the largest-ever decline in imports.Frontloading in the run-up the tariffs clearly was massive and then collapsed. This also suggests that after its big negative contribution to US GDP growth in Q1 it will be a significant positive factor in Q2. Inventory effects will likely attenuate some of its effect. Bloomberg noted that a drop in imports of pharmaceuticals from Ireland was responsible for an almost $20bn swing in the deficit. The opposite (statistical) effect is thus going to be seen in Europe in Q2. Ireland yesterday reported a significant upward revision in Q1 GDP (which now points to a revision in Eurozone GDP growth to around +0.6% q\/q (!) from 0.3% previously). But this will obviously turn to a significant drag in Q2 as those US trade numbers for April just signaled.Staying in Europe, the ECB seemingly presented itself as an anchor of stability in these times of highs and lows. Lagarde\u2019s new mantra is now \u201cwell positioned\u201d, which could be viewed in our opinion as code language for \u201cwe\u2019re done cutting, unless...\u201d. This becomes even clearer when you compare it to the previous mantra Lagarde introduced in March when she called ECB policy \u201cmeaningfully less restrictive\u201d. We had expected little to no guidance from yesterday\u2019s policy meeting, but these new words \u2013 despite lower oil prices and a stronger euro \u2013 lead us to maintain our view that we have reached the terminal rate.However, the ECB leaves ample room to respond if things do not work out the way they envisage. Indeed, it lowered its inflation forecast significantly with core inflation positioned around 2% for the coming years. Moreover, its new scenario analyses unveiled a dovish reaction function to a potential escalation of trade tensions. Should this happen, and paused tariffs were to be reinstated, the ECB\u2019s economists estimate that this could lower GDP growth through 2027 by about 1% cumulatively. And, interestingly, they conclude that inflation would be somewhat lower as well: in such a scenario inflation would average 1.8% in 2027, and that includes the assumption that the EU retaliates. By contrast, our own econometric analysis indicates that European tariffs on the US would be (mildly) inflationary instead.Lagarde did say that their modelling exercise assumed that higher tariffs could lead to lower demand for euro area exports and to countries with overcapacity rerouting their exports to the euro area thereby putting more downward pressure on inflation. However, she acknowledged that the ECB\u2019s analysis did not include any inflationary impact from a disruption of supply chains. Although this effect, admittedly, is surrounded by even more uncertainty, we did take this into account in our own scenario analysis (which explains why we still have inflation somewhat above the ECB\u2019s target even in 2026). And one only need to take a quick glance at container freight rates (benchmark composite by WCI up by a staggering 175% compared to last month) to understand why be believe the ECB the ECB could be under-estimating the potential highs.Time will tell, of course. But one thing that the ECB may be right about, is the (initial) downward pressure on imported goods prices due to a diversion of trade. The European Commission yesterday published its first assessment from its trade diversion monitoring tool that was launched in April. The early warning system tracks shipments and prices of goods at a high level of detail. In the short-run lower prices may benefit European importers and thereby consumers, but if those prices are the result of overcapacity in other parts of the world (such as China) this could also undermine European producers. The South China Morning Post reported that \u201cin the month to May 25, imports of light-emitting diodes surged 156 per cent, while their price fell 65 per cent. Shipments of industrial robots shot up by 315 per cent, paired with a 35 per cent price decline. And imports of some bars and rods made from steel alloy soared by over 1,000 per cent as their price plunged 86 per cent.\u201dWhilst such figures can be extremely volatile due to their level of detail, seasonal patterns etc. and make no distinction between the origin of the content, a heatmap by the Commission shows that China was a significant contributor to these changes. The FT writes that the surge in steel imports, driven by trade diversion, is setting off alarm bells in the steel sector. Forecasting the next steps by the European Commission is a rather speculative affair, but we\u2019d not be surprised if this leads to some form of action. This year the Commission has already launched more than 10 cases against China and\/or Chinese producers (based on our count of news articles on the EU\u2019s trade defense website).

        "title":"The \u2018cracks in the foundation' of the job market are starting to show, economist says\u2014and the big picture is worse than it seems",
        "description":"The latest economic reports show a surprisingly stable U.S. job market, but there are \u201ccracks in the foundation\u201d that could spell trouble for workers in the coming months, according to Andrew Flowers, chief economist at Appcast, a recruitment marketing provider.The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, beating expectations and down slightly from 147,000 in April, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% while the underemployed rate, or the share of part-time workers who want full-time jobs, remained unchanged at 7.8%.Looking at the bigger picture, the job market is \u201ctreading water\u201d and \u201cworse than what the topline number says,\u201d Flowers tells CNBC Make It. The economy netted an average 144,000 new jobs every month in the last year. That\u2019s the lowest since 2011, excluding the pandemic-era drop, Flowers says .Meanwhile, the bulk of available positions come from health care, leisure and hospitality, and social assistance. These sectors generally fuel a lot of new work, but tariffs and health-care policies in the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d could limit their growth, Flowers says.The spending bill, which passed the House and is now under consideration in the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $700 billion and make signing up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces harder and more expensive.Federal funding cuts to health care, which has accounted for roughly 30% of new jobs in the past three years, could \u201ckill the golden goose, so to speak,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cHealth care has been the one stalwart industry to power job growth.\u201dLeisure and hospitality work could similarly be in danger as businesses pass the cost of new tariffs on to customers, and consumers pull back on spending, Flowers says.Tariffs are already \u201cstarting to bite,\u201d Flowers adds, pointing to declines in the warehousing and retail jobs that buoyed April job growth. \u201cGoing forward, a lot of the eggs are in one basket, which is health care.\u201d\u2018The job-finding rate is really slipping\u2019The job-search experience, meanwhile, remains challenging.Some 40% of job-seekers are not confident in the number of jobs available today, and nearly a third expect fewer jobs to be available six months from now, according to ZipRecruiter\u2019s latest job-seeker confidence index.\u201cIt\u2019s an insider vs. outsider labor market,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cIf you have a job, it\u2019s actually pretty good.\u201d Layoffs are relatively low while the unemployment rate is steady and wage growth is strong. But \u201cthe job-finding rate is really slipping\u201d for those on the market, especially for entry-level workers getting their first jobs out of high school or college, Flowers says.Growth is weak around knowledge-worker jobs in finance, marketing, sales and software development, while the professional and business services sector sheds jobs, Flowers says.\u2018We\u2019ve told young people in this country for decades, \u2018Go to college.\u2019 And they did,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cNow all the jobs they want, whether it\u2019s in tech, marketing, sales, banking or for the federal government, those are all the weakest areas.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on this collision course where young people are going to face a harder time getting the jobs that they wanted, but all the blue-collar jobs are going to be very hard to fill,\u201d Flowers says.Overall, the U.S. economy has contracted over the last six weeks, as shown in declining business growth, higher prices and slower hiring, according to a new Federal Reserve report.\u201cAll Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions,\u201d according to the report. It noted hiring was \u201clittle changed\u201d and \u201cflat\u201d in some districts where candidate pools are growing, but turnover remains stubbornly low.Are you ready to buy a house?

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%. European equities are little changed as investors search for fresh catalysts on trade negotiations between the US and China and look ahead to a key US jobs report.

WSJWe estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 110k in May, below consensus of 125k and the three-month average of +155k. On the positive side, big data indicators suggested a healthy pace of job creation. On the negative side, trade policy uncertainty was very high across the survey period and we expect another 10k decline in federal government payrolls from workforce reductions.

After printing a multi-year high yesterday @ 1.3616, Cable has since retreated and moved back below the 1.3550 mark.Antipodeans - Antipodeans are steady vs. the USD following a light data docket and relevant newsflow overnight. Both continue to keep an eye on US-Sino relations following the Xi-Trump call yesterday given their trade exposure. However, the readout had little follow-through into either currency. AUD\/USD has moved back onto a 0.64 handle and pulled back from yesterday's YTD peak @ 0.6538. NZD\/USD has also retreated from yesterday's YTD high @ 0.6080 but is still holding above the 0.60 mark.NBP's Litwiniuk said they need to be cautious regarding the disinflation path; MPC can return to the subject of cuts in July or September; rates can still be cut by 100-125bps this year.TreasuriesUSTs - USTs are a touch higher ahead of the US jobs report and following yesterday's ECB-led losses which outmuscled a spike higher in weekly claims metrics. As it stands, the next 25bps cut is not fully priced until September with 54bps of loosening seen by year-end. Sep'25 USTs are currently within yesterday's 110.23+ to 111.14+ range. From a yield perspective, the US curve is fractionally in bull flattening mode, whilst the 10yr yield has moved back to the 4.37% after venturing as low as 4.318% yesterday.Bunds - Bunds are attempting to atone for yesterday's losses which were seen in the wake of the ECB rate decision. Sep'25 Bunds have been as high as 130.72 but are still some way away from yesterday's peak @ 131.47. The 10yr yield is back below the 2.55% mark after climbing as high as 2.581% yesterday.Gilts - Gilts are currently being led by the upside in German paper as UK-specific newsflow remains light ahead of next week's UK spending review. Sep'25 Gilts have been as high as 92.31 but still have some ground to cover before approaching yesterday's best @ 92.63. The 10yr yield currently sits just above the 4.6% mark and within yesterday's 4.557-4.648% range.CommoditiesCrude Futures - Subdued trade amid a firmer Dollar and overall cautious risk tone heading into the US jobs report before the weekend. Contracts saw a leg lower likely on technicals as WTI dipped under USD 63.00\/bbl at the same time as Brent fell under USD 65.00\/bbl, although prices thereafter stabilised. News flow has been light for the complex, with nothing major to report in geopolitics either.Precious Metals - Spot gold and silver are largely treading water amid a lack of catalysts during the European morning in the run-up to the US jobs report. Spot gold currently resides in a current USD 3,351.49-3,375.29\/oz range, well within yesterday's USD 3,338.29-3,403.15\/oz parameter.Base Metals - Mixed trade across base metals, in fitting with the cautious risk tone ahead of the US jobs report, with the Trump-Xi phone call doing little to keep broader prices underpinned during this session. 3M LME copper dipped back under USD 9,700\/t to trade in a USD 9,659.00-9,768.00\/t range at the time of writing.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%. European equities are little changed as investors search for fresh catalysts on trade negotiations between the US and China and look ahead to a key US jobs report. The real estate and health care sectors outperform, while consumer shares are among the biggest laggards.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed. Indian stocks rose after the central bank cut interest rates more than projected and unexpectedly reduced the cash reserve ratio for banks. Gauges in Hong Kong fell, while those in Japan rebounded. Markets in Indonesia, Philippines and South Korea were closed for holidays.In rates, treasuries edge higher ahead of the jobs report, with US 10-year yields falling nearly 2 bps to 3.37%.

NikkeiIran orders thousands of tons of ballistic missile material from China as Tehran looks to rebuild its arsenal and provide more weapons to proxies in the Middle East. WSJWe estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 110k in May, below consensus of 125k and the three-month average of +155k. On the positive side, big data indicators suggested a healthy pace of job creation. On the negative side, trade policy uncertainty was very high across the survey period and we expect another 10k decline in federal government payrolls from workforce reductions.

ASX 200 saw two-way, rangebound trade as outperformance in the energy and utilities sectors was counterbalanced by losses in gold miners and the top-weighted financial industry, while a lack of pertinent data releases also contributed to the uneventful picture. Nikkei 225 gained with the index supported by recent currency weakness although further upside was capped following disappointing Household Spending data which showed a steeper-than-feared M\/M decline and a surprise Y\/Y contraction.

Attention now is firmly fixated on today's NFP report which is set to see payroll growth slow to 130k from 177k and unemployment rate hold steady @ 4.2%. As it stands, the next 25bps cut is not fully priced until September with 54bps of loosening seen by year-end. DXY is towards the top end of yesterday's 98.35-98.94 range.EUR - EUR is trivially softer vs. the USD after gaining yesterday on account of the ECB rate decision which saw policymakers pull the trigger on a 25bps rate cut, whilst noting that policy is \"well-positioned\"; suggesting that the ECB could be nearing or at the end of its cutting cycle. ECB speak this morning hasn't shifted the dial with policymakers signalling flexibility going forward, whilst acknowledging progress on inflation. EUR\/USD is contained within yesterday's 1.1404-1.1495 range.JPY - JPY is the laggard across the majors following disappointing Household Spending data. Subsequently, USD\/JPY briefly made its way back onto a 144 handle with a current session peak @ 144.13, stopping shy of the WTD high @ 144.39. On the trade front, Japan's government said trade negotiator Akazawa met with US Commerce Secretary Lutnick and Akazawa strongly sought a review of US tariffs. Elsewhere, Japan's former top FX diplomat says narrowing US-Japan rate gap will likely support the yen at around 135-140 against USD by year-end.GBP - GBP is softer vs. the broadly firmer USD with UK-specific newsflow on the light side ahead of next week's UK spending review. On which, UK Chancellor Reeves reaffirmed she will not have a UK budget like October's again, but can't rule out any tax changes over the next four years. For today's agenda, BoE Chief Economist Pill is due to speak @ 13:00BST, but given the subject matter of \"AI and Households\", it is unclear how much he will touch on monetary policy. After printing a multi-year high yesterday @ 1.3616, Cable has since retreated and moved back below the 1.3550 mark.Antipodeans - Antipodeans are steady vs. the USD following a light data docket and relevant newsflow overnight. Both continue to keep an eye on US-Sino relations following the Xi-Trump call yesterday given their trade exposure. However, the readout had little follow-through into either currency. AUD\/USD has moved back onto a 0.64 handle and pulled back from yesterday's YTD peak @ 0.6538. NZD\/USD has also retreated from yesterday's YTD high @ 0.6080 but is still holding above the 0.60 mark.NBP's Litwiniuk said they need to be cautious regarding the disinflation path; MPC can return to the subject of cuts in July or September; rates can still be cut by 100-125bps this year.TreasuriesUSTs - USTs are a touch higher ahead of the US jobs report and following yesterday's ECB-led losses which outmuscled a spike higher in weekly claims metrics. As it stands, the next 25bps cut is not fully priced until September with 54bps of loosening seen by year-end. Sep'25 USTs are currently within yesterday's 110.23+ to 111.14+ range. From a yield perspective, the US curve is fractionally in bull flattening mode, whilst the 10yr yield has moved back to the 4.37% after venturing as low as 4.318% yesterday.Bunds - Bunds are attempting to atone for yesterday's losses which were seen in the wake of the ECB rate decision. Sep'25 Bunds have been as high as 130.72 but are still some way away from yesterday's peak @ 131.47. The 10yr yield is back below the 2.55% mark after climbing as high as 2.581% yesterday.Gilts - Gilts are currently being led by the upside in German paper as UK-specific newsflow remains light ahead of next week's UK spending review. Sep'25 Gilts have been as high as 92.31 but still have some ground to cover before approaching yesterday's best @ 92.63. The 10yr yield currently sits just above the 4.6% mark and within yesterday's 4.557-4.648% range.CommoditiesCrude Futures - Subdued trade amid a firmer Dollar and overall cautious risk tone heading into the US jobs report before the weekend. Contracts saw a leg lower likely on technicals as WTI dipped under USD 63.00\/bbl at the same time as Brent fell under USD 65.00\/bbl, although prices thereafter stabilised. News flow has been light for the complex, with nothing major to report in geopolitics either.Precious Metals - Spot gold and silver are largely treading water amid a lack of catalysts during the European morning in the run-up to the US jobs report. Spot gold currently resides in a current USD 3,351.49-3,375.29\/oz range, well within yesterday's USD 3,338.29-3,403.15\/oz parameter.Base Metals - Mixed trade across base metals, in fitting with the cautious risk tone ahead of the US jobs report, with the Trump-Xi phone call doing little to keep broader prices underpinned during this session. 3M LME copper dipped back under USD 9,700\/t to trade in a USD 9,659.00-9,768.00\/t range at the time of writing.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

        "description":"US Equity Futures Unchanged Ahead Of ECB As Jobs Data Looms US equity futures are unchanged, as they struggle for direction ahead of Friday\u2019s payrolls report, following a series of data releases that offered mixed signals on the health of the economy. As of 8:00am, S&P futures are flat, having traded on either side of the unchanged line during the overnight session and followed a slurry of weak macro data releases which saw Wednesday's gains erase and recover, with the S&P ultimately ending the day flat. Nasdaq 100 futs are down 0.1% with Mag 7 stocks mostly higher except for TSLA (-1.6%). Stocks and bonds in Europe gained ahead of the ECB's expected 8th consecutive interest rate cut. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries steadied as Wednesday\u2019s bond rally faded. The dollar reversed earlier losses even as gold surged to briefly top $3400. Commodities are mostly mixed with notable outperformance in silver (+3.1%). News flow since yesterday\u2019s close has been largely muted: headlines continue to focus on trade negotiation development, particularly implication on rare earth curbs (BBG and CNBC) and upcoming Trump-Xi call.In premarket trading, the Mag 7 stocks are mixed (Alphabet +1.3%, Amazon +0.7%, Meta +0.2%, Microsoft 0%, Tesla -2.6%, Nvidia -0.5%, Apple -0.3%). Broadcom shares rise 1% in premarket ahead of earnings due after the bell. Chewy shares (CHWY) are down 2.4% premarket after Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala cut the recommendation on the online retailer of pet products to hold from buy, writing that valuation appears \u201cprimed\u201d for a first-quarter beat and raise that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Dollar Tree Inc. shares (DLTR) are up 1.6% in premarket trading, after JPMorgan upgraded the discount retailer to overweight from neutral. Here are some other notable movers: Five Below (FIVE) gains 6% in premarket trading after the discount stores company reported first-quarter results that beat expectations and guided for net sales in the second quarter that are above estimates.Nebius shares (NBIS) gain 5.6% in US premarket trading after the AI infrastructure software provider is initiated with a buy rating at Arete Research, while peer CoreWeave declines 2% after getting new neutral rating.PVH shares (PVH) drop 7.9% in premarket trading after the Calvin Klein owner cut its full-year adjusted earnings guidance, and noted that the outlook reflects an estimated net negative impact in relation to tariffs placed on goods coming into the US.Planet Labs shares (PL) jump 20% in premarket trading after first-quarter revenue beat estimates. Analysts at Citizens said the satellite data provider had a \u201cstellar quarter\u201d and the stock remains an opportunity for long-term capital appreciation.Visa shares (V) rise 1% in premarket trading on Thursday as Mizuho Securities raises the stock to outperform from neutral, saying the cash-to-card runway in the US still has room to grow.The wild swings in stocks that were sparked by the Trump administration\u2019s tariff announcements in April \u2014 and subsequent rebound \u2014 have given way to more subdued daily moves in recent weeks. The US benchmark has remained largely flat since mid-May as traders assess the impact of the trade war on economic activity.Friday\u2019s jobs report is expected to show that growth in nonfarm payrolls slowed and the unemployment rate remained steady. While the figures would chime with Wednesday data that showed a contraction in US services and a deceleration in private hiring, separate data earlier in the week unexpectedly showed a fairly broad advance in US job openings.\u201cConsensus is for lower job creation,\u201d said Ulrich Urbahn, head of multi-asset strategy and research at Berenberg. \u201cI think there must be a big surprise to the downside for volatility to increase.\u201dSome investors are warning that the current period of relative market calm could once again give way to volatility, as uncertainty lingers over the outcome of trade negotiations between the US and its biggest trading partners \u2014 and the full economic impact remains unclear.\u201cOur bias remains to sell any rallies\u201d in US bonds, said Mohit Kumar, chief European strategist at Jefferies International. \u201cWe are concerned over the fiscal deficits and the willingness of the rest of the world to continue financing US fiscal deficits.\u201dThe European Central Bank is set to cut rates for an eighth time later on Thursday. Another reduction is expected in September, when trade talks with the US should have concluded and fresh forecasts will reveal the full implications of the tariffs. And speaking of Europe, the Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, rising for a third day ahead of a widely anticipated interest-rate cut by the European Central Bank. European stocks were on track for the highest close in more than two weeks. Technology, construction and health care stocks are leading gains while travel and retail provide a drag. Here are the biggest European movers:Bayer shares rise as much as 5.1% after Goldman Sachs upgrades the German chemicals and pharmaceutical company to buy from neutral, saying it sees earnings as having bottomed out and thinks risks around litigation and pharma data are overdone.Dr. Martens surges as much as 17%, the most since November, after the UK bootmaker releases its full-year results and outlines its new \u2018Levers For Growth\u2019 strategy update.Redcare shares rise as much as 2.3%, paring some of Wednesday\u2019s 14% drop that was spurred by a rating downgrade at Kepler Cheuvreux. Concerns about structural challenges related to the anticipated phaseout of the CardLink system are \u201cunwarranted and lack concrete support,\u201d according to Deutsche Bank analysts.Wise shares rise as much as 9% to a record high after the money-transfer firm said it intends to seek a primary listing in the US to enhance visibility to the investment community and the stock\u2019s trading.Burckhardt shares gain as much as 6%, to the highest level since February, with Vontobel analysts saying the Swiss compressors manufacturer delivered significant margin progress compared to last year, driven by a good product mix.Wizz Air shares fall as much as 27%, the steepest drop since the early days of the pandemic, after the airline\u2019s cost guidance and fourth-quarter results disappointed analysts.CMC Markets shares tank as much as 18% after reporting annual pretax profit below expectations after disappointing investors on costs, according to analysts at Shore Capital, while the dividend was also lower than hoped.Akzo Nobel falls as much as 2.5% as UBS cuts the recommendation on the coatings and Dulux paint maker to neutral from buy.Avolta shares drop as much as 7.9% after one of its investors sold shares at a discount to Wednesday\u2019s close.Hemnet falls as much as 8.4% to its lowest since Jan. 31 after Nordea double-downgraded its view on the Swedish real estate listings platform to sell from buy, saying recent monetization pushes for premium offerings \u201cmay have crossed a line where user price elasticity begins to invite disruption.\u201dEarlier in the session, Asian stocks edged higher, as South Korean shares extended a rally on hopes of improved corporate governance under the new president. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 0.4%, heading for its highest level in more than three years. Korea\u2019s Kospi Index jumped 1.5% after the ruling party said it will propose a revision to Commercial Act again, a key step in improving corporate governance. Benchmarks in Hong Kong and Taiwan also gained, with US economic data starting to soften and supporting the case for an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Japanese shares fell. Demand at the country\u2019s 30-year bond auction was weaker than the average over the past year. The regional benchmark\u2019s gain in recent weeks is in tandem with global peers, which closed at a record high Wednesday on expectations that the worst of higher tariffs may be over. Still, uncertainty remains high around the progress of US-China trade talks, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping making clear that a phone call doesn\u2019t come without a price. That\u2019s even as Trump is seeking a personal discussion with Beijing to prevent further escalation in trade tensions.In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is unchanged. The Japanese yen is the weakest of the G-10 currencies, falling 0.3% against the greenback. The kiwi tops the leader board with a 0.4% gain. The euro traded steady after advancing more than 10% against the dollar year-to-date.In rates, treasuries are mixed with gains only seen at the longer end of the curve. US 30-year yields fall 2 bps to 4.86%. European government bonds advance across all maturities, with UK and German 10-year yields falling 3-4 bps each. Japanese government bonds rose after an auction of 30-year debt was better than many investors had feared. Still, a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.92 at the offering pointed to a general lack of appetite for longer-maturity debt.MarketsIn commodities, oil prices are steady with WTI near $63 a barrel. Spot gold rises $12 to around $3,385\/oz. Silver rises 3% and above $35\/oz for the time since 2012.Looking to the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hear from the Fed\u2019s Kugler, Harker and Schmid, BoE Deputy Governor Breeden, and the BoE\u2019s Greene. Data releases from the UK include the weekly initial jobless claims and the April trade balance.

Furthermore, President Trump signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University.Wall Street\u2019s top regulator took a step toward toughening rules for foreign companies listed on American stock markets on Wednesday, saying many Chinese firms in particular unduly benefited from having to make fewer regular disclosures to investors. The regulator warned that foreign firms, especially ones from China, could face stricter disclosure rules. SCMPUS business optimism moved sharply lower, with only 27% of executives polled in May by the AICPA confident about the economic outlook for the 12 months ahead. BBGA private gauge of China\u2019s services sector signaled that activity picked up in May, despite a renewed fall in new export orders.

This follows a session of losses on Wednesday which were triggered by soft outturns for US ADP and ISM services PMIs. Newsflow since has been on the quiet side, aside from President Trump calling for a scrapping of the debt limit; something that appears to be very unlikely to be implemented.

Trump added it was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace, while Trump noted that Putin said very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.US is redirecting critical anti-drone technology from Ukraine to US forces in a move that reflects the Pentagon's waning commitment to Kyiv's defence, according to WSJ.Ukrainian drone attacks hit energy targets in Russian-held areas of Zaporizhzhia and the Kherson region, with tens of thousands without power, according to Russian-installed officials.Ukraine's Economy Minister said the first meeting of the Ukraine minerals fund is expected in July and Ukraine has discussed with the US about how to make the minerals fund operational by year-end.China's Guangzhou Public Security Bureau issued a bounty for cyber attack suspects that it said are linked to the Taiwan authorities.US Event Calendar7:30 am: May Challenger Job Cuts YoY, prior 62.7%8:30 am: Apr Trade Balance, est. -66b, prior -140.5b8:30 am: 1Q F Nonfarm Productivity, est. -0.8%, prior -0.8%8:30 am: 1Q F Unit Labor Costs, est. 5.7%, prior 5.7%8:30 am: May 31 Initial Jobless Claims, est. 235k, prior 240k8:30 am: May 24 Continuing Claims, est. 1910k, prior 1919kCentral Banks:12:00 pm: Fed\u2019s Kugler Speaks on Economic Outlook, Policy1:30 pm: Fed\u2019s Harker Speaks on Economic Outlook1:30 pm: Fed\u2019s Schmid Speaks on Banking PolicyDB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrapMarkets put in a strong performance yesterday, after a weak batch of US data led to a massive rally for US Treasuries, which in turn supported risk assets. So investors became a lot more confident that the Fed would still cut rates this year, and the 10yr Treasury yield fell -10.0bps on the day to 4.36%. That decline in yields had the double benefit of easing financial conditions, whilst also relaxing fears about the fiscal situation. So equities held up despite the underwhelming data, with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly reaching a 3-month high. Indeed, the index is now up +19.83% since its closing low after Liberation Day, leaving it just shy of the 20% mark that would mark the technical start of a bull market.Of course, even with the rally, the data still raised fears that the US economy lost steam into May. That started off with the ADP\u2019s report of private payrolls, which was the softest in over two years, at just +37k (vs. +114k expected). And shortly after that, we had the ISM services index, which fell to 49.9 (vs. 52.0 expected), and the details from the report weren\u2019t great either. For instance, the new orders component slumped to a two-year low of 46.4, whilst the prices paid indicator surged to 68.7, the highest since 2022. Nevertheless, investors weren\u2019t too alarmed by these data prints, as the numbers weren\u2019t so bad as to revive fears about a recession. Indeed, it\u2019s worth noting that the ISM services index had a big move lower back in December 2022, at a time when the Fed were aggressively hiking rates, which was then followed up by a strong recovery the following month. So in general, investors were reluctant to over-interpret one day\u2019s data, not least given the big test is coming tomorrow with the US jobs report. Moreover, there was a more positive signal from the final US composite PMI for May, which was revised up from the flash reading to 53.0. In terms of the market reaction, both the ADP and the ISM services prints led investors to price in more rate cuts this year, with clear moves in response to the two prints. In fact by the close, futures were pricing in 58bps of rate cuts by the Fed\u2019s December meeting, up +8.0bps on the day, and the highest number in over three weeks. And there\u2019s growing confidence that we\u2019ll see the first rate cut by September, with futures now almost fully pricing (97%) one by that meeting. Given the additional rate cuts being priced, that triggered a major surge for US Treasuries yesterday. So at the front end, the 2yr yield was down -8.5bps on the day to 3.87%. And for the 30yr yield, the -10.3bps move was actually the biggest daily decline since February, pushing the yield down to 4.88%. Only a small amount of that rally has unwound this morning, with the 10yr yield up +0.6bps, and the 30yr yield up +0.5bps.The large slide in Treasury yields had the added benefit of reassuring investors about the fiscal situation, which had been in growing focus as the 30yr yield hovered around the 5% mark. So even with the weak economic data, risk assets held up reasonably well with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly posting a 3-month high in a session that saw the lowest daily trading range for the index since mid-February. The S&P 500 now stands just -2.82% beneath its all-time high in February, although futures this morning aren\u2019t suggesting much momentum, with those on the S&P 500 down -0.05%.Meanwhile in Europe, there were consistent gains, with the STOXX 600 (+0.47%) advancing for a second day. There was some support from the final PMI numbers, with the Euro Area composite revised up from the flash reading to 50.2 (vs. flash 49.5). So that meant it was no longer beneath the 50-mark pointing towards a contraction. Over in Germany, the DAX (+0.77%) even hit a fresh record, which came as the cabinet approved a new package of corporate tax breaks. For sovereign bonds, there was a steadier performance across the continent, with yields on 10yr bunds (+0.1bps), OATs (+1.3bps) and BTPs (-0.3bps) seeing modest movements. Yesterday also brought headlines in the geopolitical sphere, although markets weren\u2019t too reactive to the various stories. Before the European open, President Trump said that President Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d So that led to a very modest slide in US equity futures. Meanwhile, Trump also posted about a conversation with Russian President Putin, which he said was \u201cnot a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.\u201d Otherwise on the trade front, there were positive noises from the US-EU trade negotiations. EU trade commissioner Maros\u030c S\u030cefc\u030covic\u030c tweeted that \u201cWe\u2019re advancing in the right direction at pace \u2013 and staying in close contact to maintain the momentum.\u201d Similarly, US trade representative Jamieson Greer said that \u201cI am pleased that negotiations are advancing quickly\u201d. Overnight in Asia we\u2019ve seen a pretty mixed performance from the major equity indices. In Japan, the Nikkei is down -0.46%, which follows a weak auction of 30yr debt, where there was the weakest demand since 2023. However, bond markets haven\u2019t reacted badly, with the 30yr yield coming down -6.6bps this morning. By contrast, South Korea\u2019s KOSPI (+1.05%) has built on yesterday\u2019s +2.66% gain, with the index currently on track to close at its highest level since mid-July. Otherwise, the Hang Seng (+0.42%) is on track for a third consecutive advance, whilst the CSI 300 (+0.07%) and the Shanghai Comp (+0.08%) have also posted modest gains this morning. Looking forward, central banks will be in the spotlight today, as the ECB are announcing their latest policy decision at 13:15 London time. It\u2019s widely expected that they\u2019ll deliver another 25bp rate cut, taking their deposit rate down to 2%. However, after a succession of consecutive cuts, there\u2019s more doubt on what happens after this meeting into year-end, as this cut would take them broadly into the middle of the neutral range. In their preview (link here), our European economists expect the ECB to keep the meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to setting policy. However, they think getting the hawks to support a June cut might require a hint of conditional patience, including an implicit willingness to pause at the next meeting in July and wait until September. Staying on central banks, the Bank of Canada left their policy rate on hold at 2.75% yesterday, in line with expectations. Afterwards, Governor Macklem said \u201cthere was a clear consensus to hold policy unchanged as we gain more information\u201d. And in future, he said \u201cmembers thought there could be a need for a reduction in the policy rate if the economy weakens in the face of continued US tariffs and uncertainty, and cost pressures on inflation are contained.\u201d By the close, the Canadian dollar had strengthened +0.31% against the US Dollar to its strongest level since early October. However, that was mainly a function of US dollar weakness, with the US Dollar weakening against every other G10 currency yesterday after the weaker US data.To the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hear from the Fed\u2019s Kugler, Harker and Schmid, BoE Deputy Governor Breeden, and the BoE\u2019s Greene. Data releases from the UK include the weekly initial jobless claims and the April trade balance. Meanwhile in Europe, there\u2019s German factory orders for April, and the May construction PMIs for Germany and the UK. Tyler DurdenThu, 06\/05\/2025 - 08:15",

        "title":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall",
        "description":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall India's central bank shocked markets this morning when it slashing interest rates (in a 5:1 vote) by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row - and the largest rate cut since the covid crash, amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy. It also spiked the amount of liquidity available in the system to kickstart moribund lending. The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years, following two previous 25bps reductions in April and February.Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is \"lower than our aspirations\" and the bank felt it was \"imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment\" amid rising global uncertainties.Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The world's (newly) most populous country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices.RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. Inflation for Fiscal Year 2026 has been revised down to 3.7% from 4%, with Q1 (April- June) projected at just 2.9%. Growth forecast remains unchanged at 6.5%. This growth is well below the 8% growth the RBI aspires for.There was another big surprise in today's announcement: alongside the greater than expected cut, the central bank changed its monetary policy stance from \"accommodative\" to \"neutral\", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves, a move which was viewed as hawkish, and sparking a sharp curve steepening. The change in stance suggests the bar for further rate cuts is now higher. As the RBI noted, after 100bps of cuts since February, policy space is now limited.However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low.The RBI also unexpectedly cut the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) rate starting September 2025 , which is set to release INR2.5tn into the banking system. With liquidity already in surplus, overnight rates may now move closer to the SDF, 25bps below the repo rate.Credit growth remains weak at 9.8% YoY (vs 19.5% a year ago). The CRR cut, to be implemented in four 25bps tranches starting September, aims to improve credit transmission. The Governor noted that announcing the schedule in advance is meant to reassure banks of the RBI\u2019s commitment to supporting liquiditySome more details from Goldman Sachs:Policy rate - lowered by 50bp with a 5:1 vote: The RBI MPC voted 5:1 to lower the policy repo rate by 50bp to 5.50% at the June meeting, vs. an expectation of a 25bp repo rate cut. External Member Bhattacharya voted for a 25bp repo rate cut. Consequently, both the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate were lowered by 50bp each to 5.75% and 5.25%, respectively.Policy stance changed to 'neutral': The MPC changed its policy stance back to 'neutral' from 'accommodative'. The Governor clarified that \"after having reduced the policy repo rate by 100 bps in quick succession since February 2025, under the current circumstances, monetary policy is left with very limited space to support growth\". We interpret this as the end of the current rate easing cycle with repo rate at 5.50% -- implying ~1% real policy rate on a one-year forward inflation forecast. The RBI may not want the ex-ante real rate below 1%, in our view, especially when the growth outlook is balanced. We had been forecasting a 5.50% repo rate marking the end of the cycle, with 25bp rate cuts each in June and August meetings, but the RBI got there a meeting faster than we expected.Growth forecast retained at 6.5% yoy for FY26: The RBI retained their growth forecast at 6.5% yoy for FY26 (GSe: 6.2% yoy), noting strong agricultural sector growth and rural demand, and a resilient services sector underpinning a recovery in urban demand. However, the Governor highlighted downside risks to growth from US \"reciprocal\" tariff-related uncertainty and prolonged geopolitical tensions.Inflation forecast lowered by 30bp to 3.7% yoy for FY26: The RBI lowered its inflation forecast by 30bp to 3.7% yoy (GSe: 3.6% yoy) (Exhibit 1). The Governor highlighted that there is \u201cgreater confidence of headline inflation remaining below the target of 4% over the course of the year\u201d. Food inflation is likely to remain benign given higher wheat and pulses (legumes) production. Additionally, Indian Meteorological Department\u2019s expectations of an above-normal monsoon bode well for the production of summer crops. However, the Governor also highlighted upside risks to the inflation outlook from weather and US \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff-related uncertainty.Banking system liquidity: The RBI announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 100bp to 3.0% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in four tranches from September to November to ease banking system liquidity further. As per the RBI\u2019s estimate, this measure is expected to release durable liquidity of INR 2.5tn (0.7% of GDP) into the banking system.The Governor said that the RBI \u201cremains committed to provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system\". With durable liquidity already in surplus in recent months, overnight rates have traded on an average ~20bp below the repo rate from April to June (Exhibit 2), resulting in a significant easing in financial conditions. As a result, overnight rates have come off by more than 150bp from mid-January to now.India's lower borrowing costs will have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector.\"This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,\" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.Predictably, Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement. Looking ahead, Goldman expects the RBI to stay on hold for the rest of the year unless growth slows sharply. The front end of the IGB curve should remain supported by strong liquidity and favorable demand-supply dynamics. The bank favors 2Y IGB and expect the IGB curve to steepen.

        "title":"Highs And Lows",
        "description":"Highs And Lows By Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at RabobankHighs and LowsBond yields were up some 5 basis points globally whilst the euro made a slight reversal after having pushed for a near high of 1.15 as the ECB concluded its press conference. From a \u2018low\u2019 inspired by 50% tariffs on US steel and aluminium imports going \u2018live\u2019 earlier this week and growing concerns about the US economy and the labor market, sentiment in financial markets briefly swung back to a \u2018high\u2019 as President Donald Trump said he had a \u201cvery good phone call\u201d with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Gains in equity markets were modest but still good enough for S&P500 to extend its rally to 20% from its 8 April low. That is, before the falling-out between Trump and Musk reached a boiling point on social media. Enough is being written about that right now, so we\u2019ll leave you at it.After the call with Xi, Trump said that both leaders have agreed to further talks and that there \u201cshould no longer be any questions respectively the complexity of Rare Earth products\u201d. That\u2019s up for various interpretations, but it suggests China has offered to speed up its process of lifting its export restrictions. Still, the Chinese readout of the call, unsurprisingly, was more nuanced and said that Xi had urged Trump to remove \u201cnegative\u201d measures that have affected trade between the countries in recent months. The upshot, from the market\u2019s perspective is that both sides are, at least, talking and that holds the prospect of further progress in removing some (still very high) tariffs. But, just for balance, Commerce Secretary Lutnick yesterday called for increased enforcement of US export controls on technology, warning that China was \u201conly attacking great American companies.\u201d If President Xi was referring to those export controls with \u201cnegative measures\u201d, the market\u2019s positive assessment may be, well, too high.That further talks with the US can lead to a \u2018deal\u2019 (as Keir Starmer can confirm), a stalemate (see EU-US) or a major escalation, as Zelensky can attest, is on any global leader\u2019s mind. Nikkei Asia reports that US negotiators Bessent, Lutnick and Greer keep Japan guessing. \u201cAt one point the three cabinet officials put the talks with the Japanese side on hold an began debating right in front of them\u201d, a source tells the Nikkei. In that sense, German Chancellor Merz came away nicely after a 40-minute meeting in the Oval Office, as he let Trump do most of the talking. Little concrete came from that meeting, though Trump acknowledged the ramp-up in German defense spending.Trade data are going from lows to highs as well, which in some cases makes the Covid-episode data look pale. As the Commerce Department confirmed, the US trade deficit for April shrunk by the most on record, to $61.6bn from $138.3bn in March, driven by the largest-ever decline in imports.Frontloading in the run-up the tariffs clearly was massive and then collapsed. This also suggests that after its big negative contribution to US GDP growth in Q1 it will be a significant positive factor in Q2. Inventory effects will likely attenuate some of its effect. Bloomberg noted that a drop in imports of pharmaceuticals from Ireland was responsible for an almost $20bn swing in the deficit. The opposite (statistical) effect is thus going to be seen in Europe in Q2. Ireland yesterday reported a significant upward revision in Q1 GDP (which now points to a revision in Eurozone GDP growth to around +0.6% q\/q (!) from 0.3% previously). But this will obviously turn to a significant drag in Q2 as those US trade numbers for April just signaled.Staying in Europe, the ECB seemingly presented itself as an anchor of stability in these times of highs and lows. Lagarde\u2019s new mantra is now \u201cwell positioned\u201d, which could be viewed in our opinion as code language for \u201cwe\u2019re done cutting, unless...\u201d. This becomes even clearer when you compare it to the previous mantra Lagarde introduced in March when she called ECB policy \u201cmeaningfully less restrictive\u201d. We had expected little to no guidance from yesterday\u2019s policy meeting, but these new words \u2013 despite lower oil prices and a stronger euro \u2013 lead us to maintain our view that we have reached the terminal rate.However, the ECB leaves ample room to respond if things do not work out the way they envisage. Indeed, it lowered its inflation forecast significantly with core inflation positioned around 2% for the coming years. Moreover, its new scenario analyses unveiled a dovish reaction function to a potential escalation of trade tensions. Should this happen, and paused tariffs were to be reinstated, the ECB\u2019s economists estimate that this could lower GDP growth through 2027 by about 1% cumulatively. And, interestingly, they conclude that inflation would be somewhat lower as well: in such a scenario inflation would average 1.8% in 2027, and that includes the assumption that the EU retaliates. By contrast, our own econometric analysis indicates that European tariffs on the US would be (mildly) inflationary instead.Lagarde did say that their modelling exercise assumed that higher tariffs could lead to lower demand for euro area exports and to countries with overcapacity rerouting their exports to the euro area thereby putting more downward pressure on inflation. However, she acknowledged that the ECB\u2019s analysis did not include any inflationary impact from a disruption of supply chains. Although this effect, admittedly, is surrounded by even more uncertainty, we did take this into account in our own scenario analysis (which explains why we still have inflation somewhat above the ECB\u2019s target even in 2026). And one only need to take a quick glance at container freight rates (benchmark composite by WCI up by a staggering 175% compared to last month) to understand why be believe the ECB the ECB could be under-estimating the potential highs.Time will tell, of course. But one thing that the ECB may be right about, is the (initial) downward pressure on imported goods prices due to a diversion of trade. The European Commission yesterday published its first assessment from its trade diversion monitoring tool that was launched in April. The early warning system tracks shipments and prices of goods at a high level of detail. In the short-run lower prices may benefit European importers and thereby consumers, but if those prices are the result of overcapacity in other parts of the world (such as China) this could also undermine European producers. The South China Morning Post reported that \u201cin the month to May 25, imports of light-emitting diodes surged 156 per cent, while their price fell 65 per cent. Shipments of industrial robots shot up by 315 per cent, paired with a 35 per cent price decline. And imports of some bars and rods made from steel alloy soared by over 1,000 per cent as their price plunged 86 per cent.\u201dWhilst such figures can be extremely volatile due to their level of detail, seasonal patterns etc. and make no distinction between the origin of the content, a heatmap by the Commission shows that China was a significant contributor to these changes. The FT writes that the surge in steel imports, driven by trade diversion, is setting off alarm bells in the steel sector. Forecasting the next steps by the European Commission is a rather speculative affair, but we\u2019d not be surprised if this leads to some form of action. This year the Commission has already launched more than 10 cases against China and\/or Chinese producers (based on our count of news articles on the EU\u2019s trade defense website).

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%. European equities are little changed as investors search for fresh catalysts on trade negotiations between the US and China and look ahead to a key US jobs report.

NikkeiIran orders thousands of tons of ballistic missile material from China as Tehran looks to rebuild its arsenal and provide more weapons to proxies in the Middle East. WSJWe estimate nonfarm payrolls rose by 110k in May, below consensus of 125k and the three-month average of +155k. On the positive side, big data indicators suggested a healthy pace of job creation. On the negative side, trade policy uncertainty was very high across the survey period and we expect another 10k decline in federal government payrolls from workforce reductions.

ASX 200 saw two-way, rangebound trade as outperformance in the energy and utilities sectors was counterbalanced by losses in gold miners and the top-weighted financial industry, while a lack of pertinent data releases also contributed to the uneventful picture.

Attention now is firmly fixated on today's NFP report which is set to see payroll growth slow to 130k from 177k and unemployment rate hold steady @ 4.2%. As it stands, the next 25bps cut is not fully priced until September with 54bps of loosening seen by year-end. DXY is towards the top end of yesterday's 98.35-98.94 range.EUR - EUR is trivially softer vs. the USD after gaining yesterday on account of the ECB rate decision which saw policymakers pull the trigger on a 25bps rate cut, whilst noting that policy is \"well-positioned\"; suggesting that the ECB could be nearing or at the end of its cutting cycle. ECB speak this morning hasn't shifted the dial with policymakers signalling flexibility going forward, whilst acknowledging progress on inflation. EUR\/USD is contained within yesterday's 1.1404-1.1495 range.JPY - JPY is the laggard across the majors following disappointing Household Spending data. Subsequently, USD\/JPY briefly made its way back onto a 144 handle with a current session peak @ 144.13, stopping shy of the WTD high @ 144.39.

Sep'25 Gilts have been as high as 92.31 but still have some ground to cover before approaching yesterday's best @ 92.63. The 10yr yield currently sits just above the 4.6% mark and within yesterday's 4.557-4.648% range.CommoditiesCrude Futures - Subdued trade amid a firmer Dollar and overall cautious risk tone heading into the US jobs report before the weekend. Contracts saw a leg lower likely on technicals as WTI dipped under USD 63.00\/bbl at the same time as Brent fell under USD 65.00\/bbl, although prices thereafter stabilised. News flow has been light for the complex, with nothing major to report in geopolitics either.Precious Metals - Spot gold and silver are largely treading water amid a lack of catalysts during the European morning in the run-up to the US jobs report. Spot gold currently resides in a current USD 3,351.49-3,375.29\/oz range, well within yesterday's USD 3,338.29-3,403.15\/oz parameter.Base Metals - Mixed trade across base metals, in fitting with the cautious risk tone ahead of the US jobs report, with the Trump-Xi phone call doing little to keep broader prices underpinned during this session. 3M LME copper dipped back under USD 9,700\/t to trade in a USD 9,659.00-9,768.00\/t range at the time of writing.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

        "description":"US Equity Futures Unchanged Ahead Of ECB As Jobs Data Looms US equity futures are unchanged, as they struggle for direction ahead of Friday\u2019s payrolls report, following a series of data releases that offered mixed signals on the health of the economy. As of 8:00am, S&P futures are flat, having traded on either side of the unchanged line during the overnight session and followed a slurry of weak macro data releases which saw Wednesday's gains erase and recover, with the S&P ultimately ending the day flat. Nasdaq 100 futs are down 0.1% with Mag 7 stocks mostly higher except for TSLA (-1.6%). Stocks and bonds in Europe gained ahead of the ECB's expected 8th consecutive interest rate cut. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries steadied as Wednesday\u2019s bond rally faded. The dollar reversed earlier losses even as gold surged to briefly top $3400. Commodities are mostly mixed with notable outperformance in silver (+3.1%). News flow since yesterday\u2019s close has been largely muted: headlines continue to focus on trade negotiation development, particularly implication on rare earth curbs (BBG and CNBC) and upcoming Trump-Xi call.In premarket trading, the Mag 7 stocks are mixed (Alphabet +1.3%, Amazon +0.7%, Meta +0.2%, Microsoft 0%, Tesla -2.6%, Nvidia -0.5%, Apple -0.3%). Broadcom shares rise 1% in premarket ahead of earnings due after the bell. Chewy shares (CHWY) are down 2.4% premarket after Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala cut the recommendation on the online retailer of pet products to hold from buy, writing that valuation appears \u201cprimed\u201d for a first-quarter beat and raise that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Dollar Tree Inc. shares (DLTR) are up 1.6% in premarket trading, after JPMorgan upgraded the discount retailer to overweight from neutral. Here are some other notable movers: Five Below (FIVE) gains 6% in premarket trading after the discount stores company reported first-quarter results that beat expectations and guided for net sales in the second quarter that are above estimates.Nebius shares (NBIS) gain 5.6% in US premarket trading after the AI infrastructure software provider is initiated with a buy rating at Arete Research, while peer CoreWeave declines 2% after getting new neutral rating.PVH shares (PVH) drop 7.9% in premarket trading after the Calvin Klein owner cut its full-year adjusted earnings guidance, and noted that the outlook reflects an estimated net negative impact in relation to tariffs placed on goods coming into the US.Planet Labs shares (PL) jump 20% in premarket trading after first-quarter revenue beat estimates. Analysts at Citizens said the satellite data provider had a \u201cstellar quarter\u201d and the stock remains an opportunity for long-term capital appreciation.Visa shares (V) rise 1% in premarket trading on Thursday as Mizuho Securities raises the stock to outperform from neutral, saying the cash-to-card runway in the US still has room to grow.The wild swings in stocks that were sparked by the Trump administration\u2019s tariff announcements in April \u2014 and subsequent rebound \u2014 have given way to more subdued daily moves in recent weeks. The US benchmark has remained largely flat since mid-May as traders assess the impact of the trade war on economic activity.Friday\u2019s jobs report is expected to show that growth in nonfarm payrolls slowed and the unemployment rate remained steady. While the figures would chime with Wednesday data that showed a contraction in US services and a deceleration in private hiring, separate data earlier in the week unexpectedly showed a fairly broad advance in US job openings.\u201cConsensus is for lower job creation,\u201d said Ulrich Urbahn, head of multi-asset strategy and research at Berenberg. \u201cI think there must be a big surprise to the downside for volatility to increase.\u201dSome investors are warning that the current period of relative market calm could once again give way to volatility, as uncertainty lingers over the outcome of trade negotiations between the US and its biggest trading partners \u2014 and the full economic impact remains unclear.\u201cOur bias remains to sell any rallies\u201d in US bonds, said Mohit Kumar, chief European strategist at Jefferies International. \u201cWe are concerned over the fiscal deficits and the willingness of the rest of the world to continue financing US fiscal deficits.\u201dThe European Central Bank is set to cut rates for an eighth time later on Thursday. Another reduction is expected in September, when trade talks with the US should have concluded and fresh forecasts will reveal the full implications of the tariffs. And speaking of Europe, the Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, rising for a third day ahead of a widely anticipated interest-rate cut by the European Central Bank. European stocks were on track for the highest close in more than two weeks. Technology, construction and health care stocks are leading gains while travel and retail provide a drag. Here are the biggest European movers:Bayer shares rise as much as 5.1% after Goldman Sachs upgrades the German chemicals and pharmaceutical company to buy from neutral, saying it sees earnings as having bottomed out and thinks risks around litigation and pharma data are overdone.Dr. Martens surges as much as 17%, the most since November, after the UK bootmaker releases its full-year results and outlines its new \u2018Levers For Growth\u2019 strategy update.Redcare shares rise as much as 2.3%, paring some of Wednesday\u2019s 14% drop that was spurred by a rating downgrade at Kepler Cheuvreux.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose as much as 0.4%, heading for its highest level in more than three years. Korea\u2019s Kospi Index jumped 1.5% after the ruling party said it will propose a revision to Commercial Act again, a key step in improving corporate governance. Benchmarks in Hong Kong and Taiwan also gained, with US economic data starting to soften and supporting the case for an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Japanese shares fell. Demand at the country\u2019s 30-year bond auction was weaker than the average over the past year. The regional benchmark\u2019s gain in recent weeks is in tandem with global peers, which closed at a record high Wednesday on expectations that the worst of higher tariffs may be over. Still, uncertainty remains high around the progress of US-China trade talks, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping making clear that a phone call doesn\u2019t come without a price. That\u2019s even as Trump is seeking a personal discussion with Beijing to prevent further escalation in trade tensions.In FX, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is unchanged. The Japanese yen is the weakest of the G-10 currencies, falling 0.3% against the greenback. The kiwi tops the leader board with a 0.4% gain. The euro traded steady after advancing more than 10% against the dollar year-to-date.In rates, treasuries are mixed with gains only seen at the longer end of the curve. US 30-year yields fall 2 bps to 4.86%. European government bonds advance across all maturities, with UK and German 10-year yields falling 3-4 bps each. Japanese government bonds rose after an auction of 30-year debt was better than many investors had feared. Still, a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.92 at the offering pointed to a general lack of appetite for longer-maturity debt.MarketsIn commodities, oil prices are steady with WTI near $63 a barrel. Spot gold rises $12 to around $3,385\/oz. Silver rises 3% and above $35\/oz for the time since 2012.Looking to the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hear from the Fed\u2019s Kugler, Harker and Schmid, BoE Deputy Governor Breeden, and the BoE\u2019s Greene.

Furthermore, President Trump signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University.Wall Street\u2019s top regulator took a step toward toughening rules for foreign companies listed on American stock markets on Wednesday, saying many Chinese firms in particular unduly benefited from having to make fewer regular disclosures to investors. The regulator warned that foreign firms, especially ones from China, could face stricter disclosure rules. SCMPUS business optimism moved sharply lower, with only 27% of executives polled in May by the AICPA confident about the economic outlook for the 12 months ahead. BBGA private gauge of China\u2019s services sector signaled that activity picked up in May, despite a renewed fall in new export orders.

This follows a session of losses on Wednesday which were triggered by soft outturns for US ADP and ISM services PMIs. Newsflow since has been on the quiet side, aside from President Trump calling for a scrapping of the debt limit; something that appears to be very unlikely to be implemented.

So investors became a lot more confident that the Fed would still cut rates this year, and the 10yr Treasury yield fell -10.0bps on the day to 4.36%. That decline in yields had the double benefit of easing financial conditions, whilst also relaxing fears about the fiscal situation. So equities held up despite the underwhelming data, with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly reaching a 3-month high. Indeed, the index is now up +19.83% since its closing low after Liberation Day, leaving it just shy of the 20% mark that would mark the technical start of a bull market.Of course, even with the rally, the data still raised fears that the US economy lost steam into May. That started off with the ADP\u2019s report of private payrolls, which was the softest in over two years, at just +37k (vs. +114k expected). And shortly after that, we had the ISM services index, which fell to 49.9 (vs. 52.0 expected), and the details from the report weren\u2019t great either. For instance, the new orders component slumped to a two-year low of 46.4, whilst the prices paid indicator surged to 68.7, the highest since 2022. Nevertheless, investors weren\u2019t too alarmed by these data prints, as the numbers weren\u2019t so bad as to revive fears about a recession. Indeed, it\u2019s worth noting that the ISM services index had a big move lower back in December 2022, at a time when the Fed were aggressively hiking rates, which was then followed up by a strong recovery the following month. So in general, investors were reluctant to over-interpret one day\u2019s data, not least given the big test is coming tomorrow with the US jobs report. Moreover, there was a more positive signal from the final US composite PMI for May, which was revised up from the flash reading to 53.0. In terms of the market reaction, both the ADP and the ISM services prints led investors to price in more rate cuts this year, with clear moves in response to the two prints. In fact by the close, futures were pricing in 58bps of rate cuts by the Fed\u2019s December meeting, up +8.0bps on the day, and the highest number in over three weeks. And there\u2019s growing confidence that we\u2019ll see the first rate cut by September, with futures now almost fully pricing (97%) one by that meeting. Given the additional rate cuts being priced, that triggered a major surge for US Treasuries yesterday. So at the front end, the 2yr yield was down -8.5bps on the day to 3.87%. And for the 30yr yield, the -10.3bps move was actually the biggest daily decline since February, pushing the yield down to 4.88%. Only a small amount of that rally has unwound this morning, with the 10yr yield up +0.6bps, and the 30yr yield up +0.5bps.The large slide in Treasury yields had the added benefit of reassuring investors about the fiscal situation, which had been in growing focus as the 30yr yield hovered around the 5% mark. So even with the weak economic data, risk assets held up reasonably well with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly posting a 3-month high in a session that saw the lowest daily trading range for the index since mid-February. The S&P 500 now stands just -2.82% beneath its all-time high in February, although futures this morning aren\u2019t suggesting much momentum, with those on the S&P 500 down -0.05%.Meanwhile in Europe, there were consistent gains, with the STOXX 600 (+0.47%) advancing for a second day. There was some support from the final PMI numbers, with the Euro Area composite revised up from the flash reading to 50.2 (vs. flash 49.5). So that meant it was no longer beneath the 50-mark pointing towards a contraction. Over in Germany, the DAX (+0.77%) even hit a fresh record, which came as the cabinet approved a new package of corporate tax breaks. For sovereign bonds, there was a steadier performance across the continent, with yields on 10yr bunds (+0.1bps), OATs (+1.3bps) and BTPs (-0.3bps) seeing modest movements. Yesterday also brought headlines in the geopolitical sphere, although markets weren\u2019t too reactive to the various stories. Before the European open, President Trump said that President Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d So that led to a very modest slide in US equity futures. Meanwhile, Trump also posted about a conversation with Russian President Putin, which he said was \u201cnot a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.\u201d Otherwise on the trade front, there were positive noises from the US-EU trade negotiations. EU trade commissioner Maros\u030c S\u030cefc\u030covic\u030c tweeted that \u201cWe\u2019re advancing in the right direction at pace \u2013 and staying in close contact to maintain the momentum.\u201d Similarly, US trade representative Jamieson Greer said that \u201cI am pleased that negotiations are advancing quickly\u201d. Overnight in Asia we\u2019ve seen a pretty mixed performance from the major equity indices. In Japan, the Nikkei is down -0.46%, which follows a weak auction of 30yr debt, where there was the weakest demand since 2023. However, bond markets haven\u2019t reacted badly, with the 30yr yield coming down -6.6bps this morning. By contrast, South Korea\u2019s KOSPI (+1.05%) has built on yesterday\u2019s +2.66% gain, with the index currently on track to close at its highest level since mid-July. Otherwise, the Hang Seng (+0.42%) is on track for a third consecutive advance, whilst the CSI 300 (+0.07%) and the Shanghai Comp (+0.08%) have also posted modest gains this morning. Looking forward, central banks will be in the spotlight today, as the ECB are announcing their latest policy decision at 13:15 London time. It\u2019s widely expected that they\u2019ll deliver another 25bp rate cut, taking their deposit rate down to 2%. However, after a succession of consecutive cuts, there\u2019s more doubt on what happens after this meeting into year-end, as this cut would take them broadly into the middle of the neutral range. In their preview (link here), our European economists expect the ECB to keep the meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to setting policy. However, they think getting the hawks to support a June cut might require a hint of conditional patience, including an implicit willingness to pause at the next meeting in July and wait until September. Staying on central banks, the Bank of Canada left their policy rate on hold at 2.75% yesterday, in line with expectations. Afterwards, Governor Macklem said \u201cthere was a clear consensus to hold policy unchanged as we gain more information\u201d. And in future, he said \u201cmembers thought there could be a need for a reduction in the policy rate if the economy weakens in the face of continued US tariffs and uncertainty, and cost pressures on inflation are contained.\u201d By the close, the Canadian dollar had strengthened +0.31% against the US Dollar to its strongest level since early October. However, that was mainly a function of US dollar weakness, with the US Dollar weakening against every other G10 currency yesterday after the weaker US data.To the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hear from the Fed\u2019s Kugler, Harker and Schmid, BoE Deputy Governor Breeden, and the BoE\u2019s Greene. Data releases from the UK include the weekly initial jobless claims and the April trade balance. Meanwhile in Europe, there\u2019s German factory orders for April, and the May construction PMIs for Germany and the UK. Tyler DurdenThu, 06\/05\/2025 - 08:15",

        "title":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall",
        "description":"India Central Bank Shocks With Biggest Rate Cut Since Covid As Growth, Inflation Stall India's central bank shocked markets this morning when it slashing interest rates (in a 5:1 vote) by a deeper-than-expected half a percent - the third cut in a row - and the largest rate cut since the covid crash, amid falling inflation and lower growth in Asia's third largest economy. It also spiked the amount of liquidity available in the system to kickstart moribund lending. The repo rate - the level at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs for home and car loans - now stands at 5.5%, the lowest in three years, following two previous 25bps reductions in April and February.Explaining the rationale for the cut, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said growth is \"lower than our aspirations\" and the bank felt it was \"imperative to stimulate domestic consumption and investment\" amid rising global uncertainties.Data released last week showed that India's economy grew by 6.5% in the previous financial year ending March. The world's (newly) most populous country remains the world's fastest expanding major economy, although growth has sharply dropped from the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, retail prices in India have slowed faster than expected to 3.16% in April - the lowest in six years - and below the RBI's 4% target, driven down by falling food prices.RBI has now forecast lower inflation than earlier projected for the year ahead. Inflation for Fiscal Year 2026 has been revised down to 3.7% from 4%, with Q1 (April- June) projected at just 2.9%. Growth forecast remains unchanged at 6.5%. This growth is well below the 8% growth the RBI aspires for.There was another big surprise in today's announcement: alongside the greater than expected cut, the central bank changed its monetary policy stance from \"accommodative\" to \"neutral\", indicating that further rate cuts will depend on how India's growth-inflation dynamic evolves, a move which was viewed as hawkish, and sparking a sharp curve steepening. The change in stance suggests the bar for further rate cuts is now higher. As the RBI noted, after 100bps of cuts since February, policy space is now limited.However, fuller granaries due to a better-than-expected monsoon, weaker prices of commodities like oil - of which India is a net importer - as well as a strong currency are likely to help keep India's inflation in check in the months ahead, allowing the RBI to keep rates low.The RBI also unexpectedly cut the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) rate starting September 2025 , which is set to release INR2.5tn into the banking system. With liquidity already in surplus, overnight rates may now move closer to the SDF, 25bps below the repo rate.Credit growth remains weak at 9.8% YoY (vs 19.5% a year ago). The CRR cut, to be implemented in four 25bps tranches starting September, aims to improve credit transmission. The Governor noted that announcing the schedule in advance is meant to reassure banks of the RBI\u2019s commitment to supporting liquiditySome more details from Goldman Sachs:Policy rate - lowered by 50bp with a 5:1 vote: The RBI MPC voted 5:1 to lower the policy repo rate by 50bp to 5.50% at the June meeting, vs. an expectation of a 25bp repo rate cut. External Member Bhattacharya voted for a 25bp repo rate cut. Consequently, both the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate were lowered by 50bp each to 5.75% and 5.25%, respectively.Policy stance changed to 'neutral': The MPC changed its policy stance back to 'neutral' from 'accommodative'. The Governor clarified that \"after having reduced the policy repo rate by 100 bps in quick succession since February 2025, under the current circumstances, monetary policy is left with very limited space to support growth\". We interpret this as the end of the current rate easing cycle with repo rate at 5.50% -- implying ~1% real policy rate on a one-year forward inflation forecast. The RBI may not want the ex-ante real rate below 1%, in our view, especially when the growth outlook is balanced. We had been forecasting a 5.50% repo rate marking the end of the cycle, with 25bp rate cuts each in June and August meetings, but the RBI got there a meeting faster than we expected.Growth forecast retained at 6.5% yoy for FY26: The RBI retained their growth forecast at 6.5% yoy for FY26 (GSe: 6.2% yoy), noting strong agricultural sector growth and rural demand, and a resilient services sector underpinning a recovery in urban demand. However, the Governor highlighted downside risks to growth from US \"reciprocal\" tariff-related uncertainty and prolonged geopolitical tensions.Inflation forecast lowered by 30bp to 3.7% yoy for FY26: The RBI lowered its inflation forecast by 30bp to 3.7% yoy (GSe: 3.6% yoy) (Exhibit 1). The Governor highlighted that there is \u201cgreater confidence of headline inflation remaining below the target of 4% over the course of the year\u201d. Food inflation is likely to remain benign given higher wheat and pulses (legumes) production. Additionally, Indian Meteorological Department\u2019s expectations of an above-normal monsoon bode well for the production of summer crops. However, the Governor also highlighted upside risks to the inflation outlook from weather and US \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff-related uncertainty.Banking system liquidity: The RBI announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 100bp to 3.0% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in four tranches from September to November to ease banking system liquidity further. As per the RBI\u2019s estimate, this measure is expected to release durable liquidity of INR 2.5tn (0.7% of GDP) into the banking system.The Governor said that the RBI \u201cremains committed to provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system\". With durable liquidity already in surplus in recent months, overnight rates have traded on an average ~20bp below the repo rate from April to June (Exhibit 2), resulting in a significant easing in financial conditions. As a result, overnight rates have come off by more than 150bp from mid-January to now.India's lower borrowing costs will have a positive growth impact due to improved purchasing power for households, lower input costs for companies and lower debt servicing costs for the government. They will also help homebuyers and a struggling real estate sector.\"This effectively lowers the cost of borrowing, making home loan EMIs [mortgage payments] easier on the pocket and thereby directly improving affordability for buyers. This can potentially boost demand in the Indian real estate sector, especially in affordable and mid-income segments. Affordable housing faced the sharpest pandemic fallout, with sales and new launches shrinking in the top 7 cities,\" Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK Group, said.Predictably, Indian markets rallied sharply post the rate cut announcement. Looking ahead, Goldman expects the RBI to stay on hold for the rest of the year unless growth slows sharply. The front end of the IGB curve should remain supported by strong liquidity and favorable demand-supply dynamics. The bank favors 2Y IGB and expect the IGB curve to steepen.

        "title":"The \u2018cracks in the foundation' of the job market are starting to show, economist says\u2014and the big picture is worse than it seems",
        "description":"The latest economic reports show a surprisingly stable U.S. job market, but there are \u201ccracks in the foundation\u201d that could spell trouble for workers in the coming months, according to Andrew Flowers, chief economist at Appcast, a recruitment marketing provider.The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, beating expectations and down slightly from 147,000 in April, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% while the underemployed rate, or the share of part-time workers who want full-time jobs, remained unchanged at 7.8%.Looking at the bigger picture, the job market is \u201ctreading water\u201d and \u201cworse than what the topline number says,\u201d Flowers tells CNBC Make It. The economy netted an average 144,000 new jobs every month in the last year. That\u2019s the lowest since 2011, excluding the pandemic-era drop, Flowers says .Meanwhile, the bulk of available positions come from health care, leisure and hospitality, and social assistance. These sectors generally fuel a lot of new work, but tariffs and health-care policies in the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d could limit their growth, Flowers says.The spending bill, which passed the House and is now under consideration in the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $700 billion and make signing up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces harder and more expensive.Federal funding cuts to health care, which has accounted for roughly 30% of new jobs in the past three years, could \u201ckill the golden goose, so to speak,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cHealth care has been the one stalwart industry to power job growth.\u201dLeisure and hospitality work could similarly be in danger as businesses pass the cost of new tariffs on to customers, and consumers pull back on spending, Flowers says.Tariffs are already \u201cstarting to bite,\u201d Flowers adds, pointing to declines in the warehousing and retail jobs that buoyed April job growth. \u201cGoing forward, a lot of the eggs are in one basket, which is health care.\u201d\u2018The job-finding rate is really slipping\u2019The job-search experience, meanwhile, remains challenging.Some 40% of job-seekers are not confident in the number of jobs available today, and nearly a third expect fewer jobs to be available six months from now, according to ZipRecruiter\u2019s latest job-seeker confidence index.\u201cIt\u2019s an insider vs. outsider labor market,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cIf you have a job, it\u2019s actually pretty good.\u201d Layoffs are relatively low while the unemployment rate is steady and wage growth is strong. But \u201cthe job-finding rate is really slipping\u201d for those on the market, especially for entry-level workers getting their first jobs out of high school or college, Flowers says.Growth is weak around knowledge-worker jobs in finance, marketing, sales and software development, while the professional and business services sector sheds jobs, Flowers says.\u2018We\u2019ve told young people in this country for decades, \u2018Go to college.\u2019 And they did,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cNow all the jobs they want, whether it\u2019s in tech, marketing, sales, banking or for the federal government, those are all the weakest areas.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on this collision course where young people are going to face a harder time getting the jobs that they wanted, but all the blue-collar jobs are going to be very hard to fill,\u201d Flowers says.Overall, the U.S. economy has contracted over the last six weeks, as shown in declining business growth, higher prices and slower hiring, according to a new Federal Reserve report.\u201cAll Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, which have led to hesitancy and a cautious approach to business and household decisions,\u201d according to the report. It noted hiring was \u201clittle changed\u201d and \u201cflat\u201d in some districts where candidate pools are growing, but turnover remains stubbornly low.Are you ready to buy a house?

        "description":"Futures Rise On Easing Trump-Musk Spat As Payrolls Loom S&P 500 futures rose 0.4% as Tesla shares rebounded 4% in premarket on signs that the spat between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk is cooling. Market gains had little conviction as traders brace for Friday\u2019s main event: a pivotal payrolls report (full preview here) that\u2019s likely to set the direction of travel for markets. Nasdaq futures also add 0.5% even as Broadcom shares fall 3% in premarket after giving a a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter. European stocks are little changed. Bond yields are 1-2bp lower; the USD is higher; the yen dropped after BBG reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to discuss slowing their pullback from buying government bonds at a policy meeting later this month. Commodities are mostly higher: Gold climbs $6 to around $3,358\/oz while silver tops $36\/oz. WTI falls 0.6% to $63 a barrel. Bitcoin rises 3%. Macro headlines were largely muted overnight; All eyes on NFP today.In premarket trading, Mag7 stocks are higher, led by Tesla, whose shares are set to rebound, rising 4.9% premarket, after plunging on Thursday as the feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation (Amazon +1%, Meta +0.8%, Apple +0.6%, Alphabet +0.6%, Nvidia +0.5%, Microsoft +0.4%). Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 3% after the company gave a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, suggesting that the AI spending frenzy isn\u2019t as strong as some investors anticipated. Lululemon added to the gloom after its latest earnings report highlighted the risk posed by new tariffs and exacerbated concerns about slowing growth.Docusign (DOCU) shares are down 18% after the e-signature software company gave a second-quarter billings outlook that is weaker than expected.Lululemon (LULU) shares plunge 21% after the upscale athletic clothing company cut its earnings per share forecast for the full year.Markets are still reveberating from the spat between Trump and Musk in which Trump proposed cutting off the billionaire\u2019s government contracts. Musk, who sparked the public feud by criticizing Trump\u2019s signature tax bill, later signaled that he\u2019s keen to dial down the hostility. White House aides have reportedly scheduled a call with the world\u2019s richest person for Friday in an effort to cool things down. Their public back-and-forth triggered the most spectacular real-time destruction of wealth ever, with $34 billion erased from Musk\u2019s net worth. Tesla shares are rebounding in premarket, after tanking 14% Thursday.\u201cFutures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President,\u201d said Jim Reid, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.Moves in other asset clases were more muted as traders awaited Friday\u2019s nonfarm payrolls report for fresh insight on how the Trump administration\u2019s trade war is affecting the economy. Turning to today's main event, economists see payrolls rising by 125,000 after job growth in March and April exceeded projections. The unemployment rate is seen holding at 4.2%. Weak payrolls data would be bad news for markets, with a big miss potentially sending stocks down 1.5%, according to Goldman Sachs traders (full preview here). A softening labor market would support expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least twice this year.\u201cInvestors are getting used to all the noise and are looking at concrete matters like the jobs report or budget,\u201d said Mabrouk Chetouane, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. \u201cThere is a cooling trend in the labor market, which I expect will show this afternoon. That should further reinforce our call for two or three cuts from the Fed this year.\u201dMeanwhile, BofA\u2019s Michael Hartnett is warning that global stocks are close to triggering sell signals as both fund inflows and market breadth are running too hot. The strategist said inflows to stocks and high-yield bonds have totaled 0.9% of AUM in the past four weeks. The sell signal will be set off if that exceeds 1%. European equities are little changed as investors search for fresh catalysts on trade negotiations between the US and China and look ahead to a key US jobs report.

Top gainers at the time of writing include Health Care (+0.6%), Energy (+0.5%), and Retail (+0.3%); losers include Basic Resources (-0.9%), Industrial Goods and Services (-0.4%), and Media (-0.3%). European movers - HSBC (+0.3%) chairman Mark Tucker will step down on September 30th. Adidas (-1.3%), JD Sports (-0.5%), and Puma (-1.6%) are all slipping after US apparel maker Lululemon (LULU) saw its shares tumble by over 20% in extended trading.

In addition, the use of FX market interventions may be necessary under certain circumstances to ensure appropriate monetary conditions. SNB monetary policy is geared towards the needs of Switzerland.FXUSD - USD is slightly firmer in what has ultimately been a week of losses for DXY. Attention now is firmly fixated on today's NFP report which is set to see payroll growth slow to 130k from 177k and unemployment rate hold steady @ 4.2%. As it stands, the next 25bps cut is not fully priced until September with 54bps of loosening seen by year-end. DXY is towards the top end of yesterday's 98.35-98.94 range.EUR - EUR is trivially softer vs. the USD after gaining yesterday on account of the ECB rate decision which saw policymakers pull the trigger on a 25bps rate cut, whilst noting that policy is \"well-positioned\"; suggesting that the ECB could be nearing or at the end of its cutting cycle. ECB speak this morning hasn't shifted the dial with policymakers signalling flexibility going forward, whilst acknowledging progress on inflation. EUR\/USD is contained within yesterday's 1.1404-1.1495 range.JPY - JPY is the laggard across the majors following disappointing Household Spending data. Subsequently, USD\/JPY briefly made its way back onto a 144 handle with a current session peak @ 144.13, stopping shy of the WTD high @ 144.39. On the trade front, Japan's government said trade negotiator Akazawa met with US Commerce Secretary Lutnick and Akazawa strongly sought a review of US tariffs. Elsewhere, Japan's former top FX diplomat says narrowing US-Japan rate gap will likely support the yen at around 135-140 against USD by year-end.GBP - GBP is softer vs. the broadly firmer USD with UK-specific newsflow on the light side ahead of next week's UK spending review. On which, UK Chancellor Reeves reaffirmed she will not have a UK budget like October's again, but can't rule out any tax changes over the next four years. For today's agenda, BoE Chief Economist Pill is due to speak @ 13:00BST, but given the subject matter of \"AI and Households\", it is unclear how much he will touch on monetary policy. After printing a multi-year high yesterday @ 1.3616, Cable has since retreated and moved back below the 1.3550 mark.Antipodeans - Antipodeans are steady vs. the USD following a light data docket and relevant newsflow overnight. Both continue to keep an eye on US-Sino relations following the Xi-Trump call yesterday given their trade exposure. However, the readout had little follow-through into either currency. AUD\/USD has moved back onto a 0.64 handle and pulled back from yesterday's YTD peak @ 0.6538. NZD\/USD has also retreated from yesterday's YTD high @ 0.6080 but is still holding above the 0.60 mark.NBP's Litwiniuk said they need to be cautious regarding the disinflation path; MPC can return to the subject of cuts in July or September; rates can still be cut by 100-125bps this year.TreasuriesUSTs - USTs are a touch higher ahead of the US jobs report and following yesterday's ECB-led losses which outmuscled a spike higher in weekly claims metrics. As it stands, the next 25bps cut is not fully priced until September with 54bps of loosening seen by year-end. Sep'25 USTs are currently within yesterday's 110.23+ to 111.14+ range. From a yield perspective, the US curve is fractionally in bull flattening mode, whilst the 10yr yield has moved back to the 4.37% after venturing as low as 4.318% yesterday.Bunds - Bunds are attempting to atone for yesterday's losses which were seen in the wake of the ECB rate decision. Sep'25 Bunds have been as high as 130.72 but are still some way away from yesterday's peak @ 131.47. The 10yr yield is back below the 2.55% mark after climbing as high as 2.581% yesterday.Gilts - Gilts are currently being led by the upside in German paper as UK-specific newsflow remains light ahead of next week's UK spending review. Sep'25 Gilts have been as high as 92.31 but still have some ground to cover before approaching yesterday's best @ 92.63. The 10yr yield currently sits just above the 4.6% mark and within yesterday's 4.557-4.648% range.CommoditiesCrude Futures - Subdued trade amid a firmer Dollar and overall cautious risk tone heading into the US jobs report before the weekend. Contracts saw a leg lower likely on technicals as WTI dipped under USD 63.00\/bbl at the same time as Brent fell under USD 65.00\/bbl, although prices thereafter stabilised. News flow has been light for the complex, with nothing major to report in geopolitics either.Precious Metals - Spot gold and silver are largely treading water amid a lack of catalysts during the European morning in the run-up to the US jobs report. Spot gold currently resides in a current USD 3,351.49-3,375.29\/oz range, well within yesterday's USD 3,338.29-3,403.15\/oz parameter.Base Metals - Mixed trade across base metals, in fitting with the cautious risk tone ahead of the US jobs report, with the Trump-Xi phone call doing little to keep broader prices underpinned during this session. 3M LME copper dipped back under USD 9,700\/t to trade in a USD 9,659.00-9,768.00\/t range at the time of writing.

Those included positive US-China headlines amid a call between Trump and Xi, a hawkish ECB decision and more weak data from the US. But the most remarkable was an extraordinary war of words between Trump and Elon Musk that ultimately left risks assets losing ground. Tesla\u2019s shares plunged by -14.26%, while the S&P 500 fell -0.53% despite earlier briefly moving into technical bull market territory as it climbed just over +20% since its recent low on April 8.The dramatic feud between the US President and the world\u2019s richest man emerged after Trump said during a meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor Merz that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201csurprised\u201d in Musk\u2019s recent criticism of the Republicans\u2019 budget bill, with Musk responding on X by suggesting that Trump would have lost the election without his support. The war of words then escalated on social media, with Trump posting that \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\u201d, while Musk posted that Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and responded \u201cyes\u201d to a suggestion that Trump should be impeached.Following the Trump-Musk spat, Tesla\u2019s shares slumped -14.26%, which together with a -3.55% decline on Wednesday marked its worst two-day decline (-17.30%) since 2020. The feud also weighed on US risk assets more broadly, with the S&P 500 (-0.53%) seeing ten of its eleven sector groups move lower on the day. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility index rose +0.87pts to 18.48, having been earlier on course to fall to its lowest level since late March. The tech mood has stayed subdued overnight as Broadcom\u2019s results delivered a lackluster revenue forecast. The chipmaker, which is now the 7th largest company in the S&P 500 and around $300bn of market cap ahead of Tesla, saw its shares slide by more than -4% after-hours. However S&P 500 (+0.25%) and NASDAQ 100 (+0.14%) futures are edging higher, perhaps as Musk has started to suggest on X that he would be open to a cooling-off period in his war of words with the President.Earlier on in the session we had seen a clear risk-on move on both sides of the Atlantic as a surprise Trump-Xi call raised the prospect of fresh US-China talks, leading to growing optimism that trade tensions would ease. The news of a call by Chinese state media led to an immediate jump in US equity futures. Shortly after, the rally got a further boost after Trump posted that it was \u201ca very good phone call\u201d which \u201cresulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\u201d In the post, it said that their respective teams would soon meet, and also that \u201cThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\u201d So that helped to boost market optimism, particularly after Trump had posted the previous day that Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d.The trade headlines outweighed an initial negative reaction to the latest weekly US jobless claims, which added to fears that the US labour market was finally deteriorating after Liberation Day. Initial jobless claims (one of the most timely indicators we get) moved up to 247k in the week ending May 31 (vs. 235k expected), reaching their highest level since October. Moreover, that followed the very soft ADP report the previous day, which had private payrolls up by just +37k in May. The one caveat to the claims data is that seasonals tend to boost the number a bit at this time of the year. However it\u2019s not the only evidence of a slightly weakening labour market. So that\u2019s really heightened the focus on today\u2019s jobs report for May, as any softness there would really magnify those fears. In terms of what to expect, our US economists forecast nonfarm payrolls to come in at +125k, dipping down from the +177k in March, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.Those competing factors drove a big turnaround for US Treasuries yesterday. They initially fell back, with the 10yr yield hitting an intraday low of 4.31% just after the claims data. But the hawkish ECB decision and the Trump-Xi call led to a significant turnaround, with the 10yr yield ultimately closing up +3.7bps at 4.39%. The moves were even larger at the front-end of the curve, with the 2yr yield up +5.4bps to 3.92% as investors dialled back the likelihood of Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile in Europe, the ECB was the biggest market driver yesterday. They cut rates by 25bps as expected, taking the deposit rate down to 2%. But significantly, President Lagarde signalled that they had \u201cnearly concluded\u201d the easing cycle, suggesting that policy rates weren\u2019t likely to go much lower from here. She also signalled little urgency to cut rates, saying that the current level left them \u201cin a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up.\u201d As such, the ECB appears to be saying that it may have now reached the appropriate level of rates, a stronger message than a soft signal of a pause our European economists had expected. That said, our economists see expected soft growth in H2 and more significant disinflation than projected by the ECB as still favouring some further easing. See their full reaction here.Lagarde\u2019s comments immediately drove a clear market reaction, with another 25bp ECB cut now being less than fully priced, the 2yr German yield surging +7.8bps on the day and the euro itself strengthening +0.25%. Several other details also fed into the hawkish narrative, with the policy statement saying that although trade uncertainty would be a short-term drag, \u201crising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.\u201d Later in the day, Bloomberg also reported that ECB officials thought a pause at the next meeting in July was the most likely scenario, with mixed views on whether another rate cut was likely after that. By the close, yields on 10yr bunds (+5.2bps), OATs (+4.7bps) and BTPs (+3.5bps) had all moved higher. Otherwise, equities ended the day higher with the STOXX 600 up +0.16%, but that was mainly thanks to the Trump-Xi call, as the index had been in negative territory after the hawkish ECB news.In Asia markets are relatively subdued this morning. The Nikkei (+0.24%) has risen a little on weak Japanese economic data that might delay further rate hikes by the BOJ (more below). Meanwhile, the CSI (-0.12%) and the Shanghai Composite (-0.06%) are struggling to gain traction while the Hang Seng (-0.21%) and the S&P\/ASX 200 (-0.19%) are seeing minor losses.Coming back to Japan household spending (-0.1% y\/y) unexpectedly fell in April, attributed to consumers curbing spending due to rising prices. This contrasted sharply with market expectations of a +1.5% gain following the previous month's +2.1% increase.Elsewhere yesterday, data showed the US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $61.6bn in April, reflecting the impact of the new tariffs. That was the smallest monthly deficit since September 2023, and a huge decline from the prior month's $138.3bn trade deficit. Given that lower imports mechanically add to GDP, this is expected to lead to a strong bounceback in GDP for Q2 after the Q1 contraction. Indeed, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s latest GDPNow estimate is pointing to annualised growth of +3.8% in Q2.To the day ahead now, and the main highlight will be the US jobs report for May. Over in Europe, there\u2019s also Euro Area retail sales for April, and German and French industrial production for April. Otherwise, central bank speakers include ECB President Lagarde, and the ECB\u2019s Holzmann, Simkus and Centeno. Tyler DurdenFri, 06\/06\/2025 - 07:26",

        "title":"Tariffs squeeze off-price retailers more than expected",
        "description":"In December, before Donald Trump was sworn back into office as president, tariffs were already a hot topic. Back then, several analysts saw off-price retailers as sheltered from import duties because so much of their inventory comes from other retailers and brands, which do the importing and pay the duties.But once tariffs became a reality, it became clear that they pose a greater risk to off-pricers than previously thought, according to Evercore ISI analysts led by Michael Binetti. They estimate that, counting both direct and indirect sourcing, 40% of the total containers imported to TJX\u2019s U.S. operations last year were from China, for example.\u201cDo off-pricers quietly have more exposure to China inventory than they let on?\u201d Binetti said in a May research note. \u201cThey do. While the off-pricers claim to have very little direct sourcing from China, we believe a much higher [percentage] of the product they source indirectly is from China.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean that these retailers are in the same boat as most others. The on-again, off-again nature of the tariff policy has sent most retail companies scrambling, and off-price players have reacted deftly, according to Evercore\u2019s research. For the most part, they moved to amass inventory even before the rollout of reciprocal tariffs on April 2, avoided placing orders while levies on goods from China were at 145%, then resumed them once levies plummeted to 30%.\u201cOur store checks and industry conversations suggest the off-pricers quickly pivoted their floors to categories where goods were more readily available,\u201d Binetti said, adding, though, that \u201cthe off-pricers will likely shift goods to \u2018fast boats\u2019 that cost more. Our off-price contacts think container prices could double or more in the near-term.\u201dThe viability of several of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs was called into question Wednesday when the U.S. Court of International Trade issued an injunction against levies on imports from a number of countries, including China, that rely on emergency declarations. Uncertainty persists, however, as an appeals court paused the block on Thursday.Here\u2019s how the big three U.S. off-price companies fared in Q1, and what they\u2019re saying about tariffs, inventory, pricing and more.TJXOn a call with analysts earlier this month, CEO Ernie Herrman described agility in pricing as well as buying, so that customers always find value compared to department stores or specialty stores. He said the company sources less 10% of its inventory directly from China but didn\u2019t elaborate on indirect sourcing.\u201cWhile we're not immune to tariff pressure, we are laser focused on our initiatives to offset them by remaining flexible and executing our opportunistic buying approach,\u201d he said.\u201cAs far as the pricing goes, we will always ensure that we are below \u2014 that we have a gap between us and the out-the-door price at the regular traditional retailers,\u201d he also said. \u201cHaving said that, we believe there's opportunity for us to buy better.\u201dTJX missed expectations in Q1, with gross margin down slightly compared to last year at 29.5% and net income down 3.2% to just over $1 billion. Wells Fargo analysts called the quarter \u201cgood (not great)\u201d at TJX, noting \u201csome squishiness\u201d on gross margin.Overall, net sales in the period rose 5% year over year to $13.1 billion, with comps up 3%. At the company\u2019s U.S. Marmaxx unit (TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Sierra), net sales rose 4% to $8 billion and comps rose 2%. At its U.S. HomeGoods unit (HomeGoods and Homesense), net sales rose 8% to $2.3 billion and comps rose 4%. The company maintained its guidance for the year.Ross StoresNew import levies are impacting Ross Stores\u2019 operations in a way that TJX has largely escaped, according to Evercore and Wells Fargo analysts. The retailer, which runs Ross and DD\u2019s Discounts stores, pulled its guidance for the year in light of supply and demand volatility caused by tariffs.\u201cWhile 1Q itself was \u2018fine\u2019 ... the bigger issue is that following TJX's recent print (where they effectively told us tariffs are not material)...[Ross] is telling us they are material,\u201d Wells Fargo analysts led by Ike Boruchow said in a May research note.While Ross directly imports only a small portion of its merchandise, more than half of all the merchandise it sells originates in China, CEO Jim Conroy told analysts on an earnings call. This confirms the thesis that off-price is more vulnerable to tariffs than expected, according to a May 22 research note from Evercore.The guidance pullback is likely \u201cmore due to inventory uncertainty than the actual direct financial impact of tariffs,\u201d Evercore\u2019s Binetti said. \u201cBy comparison, TJX didn\u2019t get tripped up by China exposure, but our channel work highlighted TJX began aggressively moving out of China well in advance.\u201dAccording to Conroy, there is only so much that can be done.\u201cThere's multiple things we can do to try to source product from other countries. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of product, particularly over the next six months, that's going to be imported from China for us and for every other retailer and every other off-price company,\u201d he said. \u201cSo ... the amount of flexibility that you have as you sit in the middle of the year for the next three to six months is somewhat limited.\u201dStill, margin pressures could diminish after Q2, according to Evercore analysts. \u201cWe think [Ross] pulled its guidance on little visibility to the back half as the tariff dynamics rapidly change,\u201d they said. \u201cBut [the retailer] is a very aggressive negotiator.\u201dIn Q1, sales rose 2.6% year over year to $5 billion, with flat comps. Operating margin of 12.2% was also flat to last year, and net earnings edged down 1.8% to $479 million. Conroy reiterated that Ross in particular and off-price more generally is well-positioned to weather, and even benefit, from the disruption from the aggressive U.S. trade policy \u201conce we get beyond this near-term, given just this disruption in the economy and in mainstream retail.\u201dBurlingtonBurlington CEO Michael O\u2019Sullivan told analysts Thursday that major supply disruptions for other retailers often ultimately burnish the off-price pipeline, but warned that tariffs aren\u2019t working that way so far. That\u2019s in part because tariffs can cause not just excess supply but also shortages.\u201cEvents like financial crises, disruptive weather, economic downturns, port strikes and other forms of disruption often lead to excess supply, which off-price retailers can benefit from,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, we think that the potential impact of tariffs is more complex and carries greater risk than other types of disruption.\u201dSteep levies on Chinese goods \u201ceffectively shut down the flow of merchandise,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that had continued, it would have been bad for consumers and bad for retailers, and that includes off-price retailers.\u201dStill, like TJX, Burlington reaffirmed its full-year guidance. On a call with analysts Thursday, CFO Kristin Wolfe emphasized that this assumes tariffs won\u2019t increase.Burlington likely moved more quickly than Ross to shift sourcing away from China and probably has less indirect China sourcing to begin with, according to Evercore analysts. Its shares also likely got a boost from Wednesday's court decision, various analysts said, though that decision has since been paused as court rulings continue.\u201cAny removal of tariffs is likely a positive, not only from a cost standpoint but also in the tempering of potential inflation, which we believe hit Burlington\u2019s customers particularly hard coming out of the pandemic,\u201d William Blair analysts Dylan Carden and Anna Linscott said in emailed comments.In Q1, Burlington\u2019s net sales rose just over 6% year over year to $2.5 billion, with comps flat. Gross margin expanded by 30 basis points to 43.8%. Net income rose 28.4% to $100.8 million. Regardless of how tariffs shake out, suppliers and retailers will eventually adjust, O\u2019Sullivan said.\u201cThe way to think about tariffs is that they are just one more thing,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, they are going to create uncertainty in the short term, which we will navigate, but they are not likely to affect the longer term structural trends in our industry. As we have discussed in the past, we see these longer term trends as being favorable for off price and our business.\u201d",

        "description":"US Equity Futures Unchanged Ahead Of ECB As Jobs Data Looms US equity futures are unchanged, as they struggle for direction ahead of Friday\u2019s payrolls report, following a series of data releases that offered mixed signals on the health of the economy. As of 8:00am, S&P futures are flat, having traded on either side of the unchanged line during the overnight session and followed a slurry of weak macro data releases which saw Wednesday's gains erase and recover, with the S&P ultimately ending the day flat. Nasdaq 100 futs are down 0.1% with Mag 7 stocks mostly higher except for TSLA (-1.6%). Stocks and bonds in Europe gained ahead of the ECB's expected 8th consecutive interest rate cut. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries steadied as Wednesday\u2019s bond rally faded. The dollar reversed earlier losses even as gold surged to briefly top $3400. Commodities are mostly mixed with notable outperformance in silver (+3.1%). News flow since yesterday\u2019s close has been largely muted: headlines continue to focus on trade negotiation development, particularly implication on rare earth curbs (BBG and CNBC) and upcoming Trump-Xi call.In premarket trading, the Mag 7 stocks are mixed (Alphabet +1.3%, Amazon +0.7%, Meta +0.2%, Microsoft 0%, Tesla -2.6%, Nvidia -0.5%, Apple -0.3%). Broadcom shares rise 1% in premarket ahead of earnings due after the bell. Chewy shares (CHWY) are down 2.4% premarket after Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala cut the recommendation on the online retailer of pet products to hold from buy, writing that valuation appears \u201cprimed\u201d for a first-quarter beat and raise that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Dollar Tree Inc. shares (DLTR) are up 1.6% in premarket trading, after JPMorgan upgraded the discount retailer to overweight from neutral. Here are some other notable movers: Five Below (FIVE) gains 6% in premarket trading after the discount stores company reported first-quarter results that beat expectations and guided for net sales in the second quarter that are above estimates.Nebius shares (NBIS) gain 5.6% in US premarket trading after the AI infrastructure software provider is initiated with a buy rating at Arete Research, while peer CoreWeave declines 2% after getting new neutral rating.PVH shares (PVH) drop 7.9% in premarket trading after the Calvin Klein owner cut its full-year adjusted earnings guidance, and noted that the outlook reflects an estimated net negative impact in relation to tariffs placed on goods coming into the US.Planet Labs shares (PL) jump 20% in premarket trading after first-quarter revenue beat estimates.

Benchmarks in Hong Kong and Taiwan also gained, with US economic data starting to soften and supporting the case for an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Japanese shares fell. Demand at the country\u2019s 30-year bond auction was weaker than the average over the past year.

So investors became a lot more confident that the Fed would still cut rates this year, and the 10yr Treasury yield fell -10.0bps on the day to 4.36%. That decline in yields had the double benefit of easing financial conditions, whilst also relaxing fears about the fiscal situation. So equities held up despite the underwhelming data, with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly reaching a 3-month high. Indeed, the index is now up +19.83% since its closing low after Liberation Day, leaving it just shy of the 20% mark that would mark the technical start of a bull market.Of course, even with the rally, the data still raised fears that the US economy lost steam into May. That started off with the ADP\u2019s report of private payrolls, which was the softest in over two years, at just +37k (vs. +114k expected). And shortly after that, we had the ISM services index, which fell to 49.9 (vs. 52.0 expected), and the details from the report weren\u2019t great either. For instance, the new orders component slumped to a two-year low of 46.4, whilst the prices paid indicator surged to 68.7, the highest since 2022. Nevertheless, investors weren\u2019t too alarmed by these data prints, as the numbers weren\u2019t so bad as to revive fears about a recession. Indeed, it\u2019s worth noting that the ISM services index had a big move lower back in December 2022, at a time when the Fed were aggressively hiking rates, which was then followed up by a strong recovery the following month. So in general, investors were reluctant to over-interpret one day\u2019s data, not least given the big test is coming tomorrow with the US jobs report. Moreover, there was a more positive signal from the final US composite PMI for May, which was revised up from the flash reading to 53.0. In terms of the market reaction, both the ADP and the ISM services prints led investors to price in more rate cuts this year, with clear moves in response to the two prints. In fact by the close, futures were pricing in 58bps of rate cuts by the Fed\u2019s December meeting, up +8.0bps on the day, and the highest number in over three weeks. And there\u2019s growing confidence that we\u2019ll see the first rate cut by September, with futures now almost fully pricing (97%) one by that meeting. Given the additional rate cuts being priced, that triggered a major surge for US Treasuries yesterday. So at the front end, the 2yr yield was down -8.5bps on the day to 3.87%. And for the 30yr yield, the -10.3bps move was actually the biggest daily decline since February, pushing the yield down to 4.88%. Only a small amount of that rally has unwound this morning, with the 10yr yield up +0.6bps, and the 30yr yield up +0.5bps.The large slide in Treasury yields had the added benefit of reassuring investors about the fiscal situation, which had been in growing focus as the 30yr yield hovered around the 5% mark. So even with the weak economic data, risk assets held up reasonably well with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly posting a 3-month high in a session that saw the lowest daily trading range for the index since mid-February. The S&P 500 now stands just -2.82% beneath its all-time high in February, although futures this morning aren\u2019t suggesting much momentum, with those on the S&P 500 down -0.05%.Meanwhile in Europe, there were consistent gains, with the STOXX 600 (+0.47%) advancing for a second day. There was some support from the final PMI numbers, with the Euro Area composite revised up from the flash reading to 50.2 (vs. flash 49.5). So that meant it was no longer beneath the 50-mark pointing towards a contraction. Over in Germany, the DAX (+0.77%) even hit a fresh record, which came as the cabinet approved a new package of corporate tax breaks. For sovereign bonds, there was a steadier performance across the continent, with yields on 10yr bunds (+0.1bps), OATs (+1.3bps) and BTPs (-0.3bps) seeing modest movements. Yesterday also brought headlines in the geopolitical sphere, although markets weren\u2019t too reactive to the various stories. Before the European open, President Trump said that President Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d So that led to a very modest slide in US equity futures. Meanwhile, Trump also posted about a conversation with Russian President Putin, which he said was \u201cnot a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.\u201d Otherwise on the trade front, there were positive noises from the US-EU trade negotiations. EU trade commissioner Maros\u030c S\u030cefc\u030covic\u030c tweeted that \u201cWe\u2019re advancing in the right direction at pace \u2013 and staying in close contact to maintain the momentum.\u201d Similarly, US trade representative Jamieson Greer said that \u201cI am pleased that negotiations are advancing quickly\u201d. Overnight in Asia we\u2019ve seen a pretty mixed performance from the major equity indices. In Japan, the Nikkei is down -0.46%, which follows a weak auction of 30yr debt, where there was the weakest demand since 2023. However, bond markets haven\u2019t reacted badly, with the 30yr yield coming down -6.6bps this morning. By contrast, South Korea\u2019s KOSPI (+1.05%) has built on yesterday\u2019s +2.66% gain, with the index currently on track to close at its highest level since mid-July. Otherwise, the Hang Seng (+0.42%) is on track for a third consecutive advance, whilst the CSI 300 (+0.07%) and the Shanghai Comp (+0.08%) have also posted modest gains this morning. Looking forward, central banks will be in the spotlight today, as the ECB are announcing their latest policy decision at 13:15 London time. It\u2019s widely expected that they\u2019ll deliver another 25bp rate cut, taking their deposit rate down to 2%. However, after a succession of consecutive cuts, there\u2019s more doubt on what happens after this meeting into year-end, as this cut would take them broadly into the middle of the neutral range. In their preview (link here), our European economists expect the ECB to keep the meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to setting policy. However, they think getting the hawks to support a June cut might require a hint of conditional patience, including an implicit willingness to pause at the next meeting in July and wait until September. Staying on central banks, the Bank of Canada left their policy rate on hold at 2.75% yesterday, in line with expectations. Afterwards, Governor Macklem said \u201cthere was a clear consensus to hold policy unchanged as we gain more information\u201d. And in future, he said \u201cmembers thought there could be a need for a reduction in the policy rate if the economy weakens in the face of continued US tariffs and uncertainty, and cost pressures on inflation are contained.\u201d By the close, the Canadian dollar had strengthened +0.31% against the US Dollar to its strongest level since early October. However, that was mainly a function of US dollar weakness, with the US Dollar weakening against every other G10 currency yesterday after the weaker US data.To the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hear from the Fed\u2019s Kugler, Harker and Schmid, BoE Deputy Governor Breeden, and the BoE\u2019s Greene. Data releases from the UK include the weekly initial jobless claims and the April trade balance.

        "description":"US Equity Futures Unchanged Ahead Of ECB As Jobs Data Looms US equity futures are unchanged, as they struggle for direction ahead of Friday\u2019s payrolls report, following a series of data releases that offered mixed signals on the health of the economy. As of 8:00am, S&P futures are flat, having traded on either side of the unchanged line during the overnight session and followed a slurry of weak macro data releases which saw Wednesday's gains erase and recover, with the S&P ultimately ending the day flat. Nasdaq 100 futs are down 0.1% with Mag 7 stocks mostly higher except for TSLA (-1.6%). Stocks and bonds in Europe gained ahead of the ECB's expected 8th consecutive interest rate cut. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries steadied as Wednesday\u2019s bond rally faded. The dollar reversed earlier losses even as gold surged to briefly top $3400.

And speaking of Europe, the Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, rising for a third day ahead of a widely anticipated interest-rate cut by the European Central Bank. European stocks were on track for the highest close in more than two weeks. Technology, construction and health care stocks are leading gains while travel and retail provide a drag.

Korea\u2019s Kospi Index jumped 1.5% after the ruling party said it will propose a revision to Commercial Act again, a key step in improving corporate governance. Benchmarks in Hong Kong and Taiwan also gained, with US economic data starting to soften and supporting the case for an interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Japanese shares fell. Demand at the country\u2019s 30-year bond auction was weaker than the average over the past year. The regional benchmark\u2019s gain in recent weeks is in tandem with global peers, which closed at a record high Wednesday on expectations that the worst of higher tariffs may be over. Still, uncertainty remains high around the progress of US-China trade talks, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping making clear that a phone call doesn\u2019t come without a price.

Japanese government bonds rose after an auction of 30-year debt was better than many investors had feared.

Furthermore, President Trump signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University.Wall Street\u2019s top regulator took a step toward toughening rules for foreign companies listed on American stock markets on Wednesday, saying many Chinese firms in particular unduly benefited from having to make fewer regular disclosures to investors.

So investors became a lot more confident that the Fed would still cut rates this year, and the 10yr Treasury yield fell -10.0bps on the day to 4.36%. That decline in yields had the double benefit of easing financial conditions, whilst also relaxing fears about the fiscal situation. So equities held up despite the underwhelming data, with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly reaching a 3-month high. Indeed, the index is now up +19.83% since its closing low after Liberation Day, leaving it just shy of the 20% mark that would mark the technical start of a bull market.Of course, even with the rally, the data still raised fears that the US economy lost steam into May. That started off with the ADP\u2019s report of private payrolls, which was the softest in over two years, at just +37k (vs. +114k expected). And shortly after that, we had the ISM services index, which fell to 49.9 (vs. 52.0 expected), and the details from the report weren\u2019t great either. For instance, the new orders component slumped to a two-year low of 46.4, whilst the prices paid indicator surged to 68.7, the highest since 2022. Nevertheless, investors weren\u2019t too alarmed by these data prints, as the numbers weren\u2019t so bad as to revive fears about a recession. Indeed, it\u2019s worth noting that the ISM services index had a big move lower back in December 2022, at a time when the Fed were aggressively hiking rates, which was then followed up by a strong recovery the following month. So in general, investors were reluctant to over-interpret one day\u2019s data, not least given the big test is coming tomorrow with the US jobs report. Moreover, there was a more positive signal from the final US composite PMI for May, which was revised up from the flash reading to 53.0. In terms of the market reaction, both the ADP and the ISM services prints led investors to price in more rate cuts this year, with clear moves in response to the two prints. In fact by the close, futures were pricing in 58bps of rate cuts by the Fed\u2019s December meeting, up +8.0bps on the day, and the highest number in over three weeks. And there\u2019s growing confidence that we\u2019ll see the first rate cut by September, with futures now almost fully pricing (97%) one by that meeting. Given the additional rate cuts being priced, that triggered a major surge for US Treasuries yesterday. So at the front end, the 2yr yield was down -8.5bps on the day to 3.87%. And for the 30yr yield, the -10.3bps move was actually the biggest daily decline since February, pushing the yield down to 4.88%. Only a small amount of that rally has unwound this morning, with the 10yr yield up +0.6bps, and the 30yr yield up +0.5bps.The large slide in Treasury yields had the added benefit of reassuring investors about the fiscal situation, which had been in growing focus as the 30yr yield hovered around the 5% mark. So even with the weak economic data, risk assets held up reasonably well with the S&P 500 (+0.01%) narrowly posting a 3-month high in a session that saw the lowest daily trading range for the index since mid-February. The S&P 500 now stands just -2.82% beneath its all-time high in February, although futures this morning aren\u2019t suggesting much momentum, with those on the S&P 500 down -0.05%.Meanwhile in Europe, there were consistent gains, with the STOXX 600 (+0.47%) advancing for a second day. There was some support from the final PMI numbers, with the Euro Area composite revised up from the flash reading to 50.2 (vs. flash 49.5). So that meant it was no longer beneath the 50-mark pointing towards a contraction. Over in Germany, the DAX (+0.77%) even hit a fresh record, which came as the cabinet approved a new package of corporate tax breaks. For sovereign bonds, there was a steadier performance across the continent, with yields on 10yr bunds (+0.1bps), OATs (+1.3bps) and BTPs (-0.3bps) seeing modest movements. Yesterday also brought headlines in the geopolitical sphere, although markets weren\u2019t too reactive to the various stories. Before the European open, President Trump said that President Xi was \u201cVERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\u201d So that led to a very modest slide in US equity futures. Meanwhile, Trump also posted about a conversation with Russian President Putin, which he said was \u201cnot a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace.\u201d Otherwise on the trade front, there were positive noises from the US-EU trade negotiations. EU trade commissioner Maros\u030c S\u030cefc\u030covic\u030c tweeted that \u201cWe\u2019re advancing in the right direction at pace \u2013 and staying in close contact to maintain the momentum.\u201d Similarly, US trade representative Jamieson Greer said that \u201cI am pleased that negotiations are advancing quickly\u201d. Overnight in Asia we\u2019ve seen a pretty mixed performance from the major equity indices. In Japan, the Nikkei is down -0.46%, which follows a weak auction of 30yr debt, where there was the weakest demand since 2023. However, bond markets haven\u2019t reacted badly, with the 30yr yield coming down -6.6bps this morning. By contrast, South Korea\u2019s KOSPI (+1.05%) has built on yesterday\u2019s +2.66% gain, with the index currently on track to close at its highest level since mid-July. Otherwise, the Hang Seng (+0.42%) is on track for a third consecutive advance, whilst the CSI 300 (+0.07%) and the Shanghai Comp (+0.08%) have also posted modest gains this morning. Looking forward, central banks will be in the spotlight today, as the ECB are announcing their latest policy decision at 13:15 London time. It\u2019s widely expected that they\u2019ll deliver another 25bp rate cut, taking their deposit rate down to 2%. However, after a succession of consecutive cuts, there\u2019s more doubt on what happens after this meeting into year-end, as this cut would take them broadly into the middle of the neutral range. In their preview (link here), our European economists expect the ECB to keep the meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to setting policy. However, they think getting the hawks to support a June cut might require a hint of conditional patience, including an implicit willingness to pause at the next meeting in July and wait until September. Staying on central banks, the Bank of Canada left their policy rate on hold at 2.75% yesterday, in line with expectations. Afterwards, Governor Macklem said \u201cthere was a clear consensus to hold policy unchanged as we gain more information\u201d. And in future, he said \u201cmembers thought there could be a need for a reduction in the policy rate if the economy weakens in the face of continued US tariffs and uncertainty, and cost pressures on inflation are contained.\u201d By the close, the Canadian dollar had strengthened +0.31% against the US Dollar to its strongest level since early October. However, that was mainly a function of US dollar weakness, with the US Dollar weakening against every other G10 currency yesterday after the weaker US data.To the day ahead, and the main highlight will be the ECB\u2019s latest policy decision and President Lagarde\u2019s subsequent press conference. Otherwise, we\u2019ll hear from the Fed\u2019s Kugler, Harker and Schmid, BoE Deputy Governor Breeden, and the BoE\u2019s Greene. Data releases from the UK include the weekly initial jobless claims and the April trade balance. Meanwhile in Europe, there\u2019s German factory orders for April, and the May construction PMIs for Germany and the UK. Tyler DurdenThu, 06\/05\/2025 - 08:15",

        "description":"German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday will enter President Trump's televised Oval Office stage, where world leaders before him have been ambushed, scolded and sent home without lunch. The big picture: Under Trump 2.0, the Oval Office has become a danger zone for world leaders, who at the very least are subject to a series of on-camera spectacles \u2014 and at the worst, a full-blown attack.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's Washington visit took a dark turn when Trump told an aide to dim the lights before presenting a compilation of clips to back the false allegations of a \"white genocide\" in South Africa. Much of what Trump said and showed was inaccurate or debunked, Axios' Russell Contreras reported.Driving the news: Merz, whose Christian Democratic Union bested the Elon Musk-endorsed far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, will come face-to-face with the president Thursday.In a Wednesday statement posted to X, Merz described the U.S. as \"an indispensable friend and partner of Germany,\" per a translation.But in February, Merz struck a different tone, saying strengthening Europe was his \"absolute priority\" in order to \"really achieve independence\" from the U.S. In a Feb. 23 X post, he wrote that his \"impression over the last few days is that Russia and America are finding common ground \u2014 over the heads of Ukraine, and consequently over those of Europe.\"Those comments followed Vice President JD Vance's stunning Munich Security Conference speech in which he lambasted European allies over so-called censorship and decried the dangers of mass immigration.Yes, but: Some leaders have walked away from the White House relatively unscathed.Canada's Mark Carney experienced some friction \u2014 telling Trump Canada is \"is not for sale\" \u2014 but avoiding the public flogging Ramaphosa and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky received.El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele leaned into the show, Axios' Dave Lawler reported, and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer came ready with a gift \u2014 an embossed letter from King Charles III.Merz's conservative immigration approach and business background could help him find common ground with Trump.Zoom in: A White House official told Axios one likely topic for the meeting with be what the administration perceives as Democratic backsliding, notably over free speech rights.Other likely discussion points include defense spending, trade and talks to end the war in Ukraine, the official said.What we're watching: MAGA world's sympathies toward the anti-immigration AfD party could be one tense undercurrent to the meeting.Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month condemned a since-suspended decision from German intelligence to classify AfD as a right-wing extremist organization.\"What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD\u2014which took second in the recent election\u2014but rather the establishment's deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes,\" Rubio, who is set to be present at Thursday's meeting, wrote.On top of that, the leader of Europe's biggest economy will have to navigate possible strain over NATO, Ukraine and ongoing trade disputes.Go deeper: German election keeps key climate player in the game",

        "title":"How Trump and Musk went from best friends to frenemies to nuclear war",
        "description":"President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are in the middle of a spectacular and tawdry breakup that has the world riveted.Here\u2019s a history of their rise and fall as best buds.Don and Elon: The Union BeginsThe Trump-Musk coupling began in earnest in July 2024, about four months before that year\u2019s presidential election. On July 13, minutes after an attempted assassination on Trump, Musk stopped dancing around his yearslong march to the MAGA right and officially endorsed Trump\u2019s campaign.The shotgun wedding happened at lightning speed, as Musk began throwing out millions of dollars to back Trump and sent millions more to his political action committee and other more underhanded vehicles to support Trump in the election.Musk could not contain his joy at joining the MAGA movement and even bounced across the stage at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, launching thousands of mocking memes.xxYouTube VideoThe DOGE HoneymoonAfter Trump won the election, both men were over the moon and wanted everyone to know about it. Trump quickly announced that Musk would get to head his Department of Government Efficiency and would effectively be allowed to do whatever he wanted, without any real oversight or ethics constraints.In January, Musk attracted an early round of criticism when he offered up a Nazi salute at ceremonies commemorating Trump\u2019s first day in office. That foreshadowed the months of chaos he and Trump would soon find themselves enmeshed in.Still, Trump began fulfilling his part of the deal and pulled back government resources investigating Musk\u2019s constellation of businesses.Elon Musk throws up a Nazi salute at an indoor presidential Inauguration event in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20.Musk vs. Trump: First Shots FiredCracks began to emerge in the bromance around the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Both men have long track records of wanting to be seen as the so-called alpha male, the guy in charge of things. But as Trump began to allow Musk and DOGE to do as they wished with an array of federal agencies, the president\u2019s team bristled at reporting and rumors that hinted that Musk was really in charge or was something of a co-president.From the outside, Americans were now making it clear they didn\u2019t like the direction in which Trump and Musk were attempting to take the country. In February, one prankster broke into the video system at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and broadcast an AI-generated video of Trump sucking on Musk\u2019s toes, with superimposed text reading, \u201cLONG LIVE THE REAL KING.\u201dEarly polling started to show that Musk was a liability for Trump. As Trump\u2019s second try at the presidency kicked off, his \u201cfirst buddy\u201d already had underwater approval ratings. Trump would soon join him there.Musk and Trump Hold Hands Against the WorldThe two men continued to put up a brave, joint front despite the slings and arrows directed their way. As Musk danced onstage with a chainsaw at a conservative conference in February to demonstrate his support of Trump and hatred for government services, Trump was rewarding Musk\u2019s companies for their boss\u2019 loyalty.Starlink, Musk\u2019s satellite internet company, was suddenly in the running for billions in government contracts, further entwining Musk\u2019s considerable fortune with taxpayer dollars\u2014even as he claimed he was cutting wasteful spending.President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to reporters near a Tesla vehicle on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11.There was a bit of an awkward moment at Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress in March. The president slammed \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d in Washington ... as Musk looked on admiringly from the audience as Trump\u2019s invited guest to the event.While pushing DOGE to destabilize the government, Musk continued to make pro-Trump gestures. His America PAC spent $1 million on ads praising Trump for doing a great job. It\u2019s like a bouquet of roses, just much more expensive.Toward the end of February, Musk got to sit in on Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting. After protests against DOGE began to crush Tesla\u2019s stock price, Trump staged a sales pitch for Tesla in front of the White House.Musk and Trump Hit a Rough PatchThen things went sour, and they went sour quickly.In early March, Musk reportedly had a fight with Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a White House meeting, and complained that Rubio hadn\u2019t fired enough people. Rubio also apparently didn\u2019t like that, via DOGE, Musk had fired officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development, which handles most of the government\u2019s foreign aid and is under the State Department\u2019s jurisdiction.Musk\u2019s actions at USAID also generated bad headlines for Trump after it was determined that key aid, food, and medicine was being denied to desperate people across the world.Musk, riding high after his millions helped Trump win an election, appeared to believe he had a magic touch, so he spent over $20 million to elect the conservative candidate for Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court seat. However, Democrats successfully pointed out the role of the unpopular billionaire interfering in state business, and in April, liberal candidate Susan Crawford easily won.President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30.After that public face-plant, reports emerged that Trump was seeking an exit for Musk. The widely reported loss in Wisconsin clearly ran counter to the image Trump has tried to build up for himself as a winner.Awkward.Knives OutIn April, Musk said White House trade advisor Peter Navarro was a \u201cmoron\u201d after Navarro slammed Musk for criticizing Trump\u2019s failing tariff policy. That same month, Trump reportedly banned Musk from attending a meeting at the Pentagon on China policy. According to an official quoted by Axios, Trump said, \u201cWhat the fuck is Elon doing there? Make sure he doesn\u2019t go.\u201dMusk benefitted immensely from Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, getting government oversight off his back and inserting his influence into the federal government. But the writing was on the wall.Last Friday, Trump ceremonially handed Musk a golden key, and the two men declared that Musk\u2019s time in government was over (even as DOGE continues to wreak havoc).This was around the time Musk first announced his opposition to Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d complaining that it doesn\u2019t hurt the middle-class and poor people enough. And he only ramped it up after that.War\u201cLook, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don\u2019t know if we will anymore,\u201d Trump said on Thursday as the breakup went global.On the same day, Musk said Trump lied about showing him the legislation before it went to Congress. Then he accused Trump\u2019s administration of covering up government files around convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein because Trump appeared in them. Musk also argued that Trump would have lost the election without his financial help.Caught in the crossfire were figures like Vice President JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who have tied themselves to Trump\u2019s political fortunes but want the millions that Musk can provide as well as the pro-Republican messages that are amplified on X, formerly Twitter.Fox News, Trump\u2019s eternal cheerleader, isn\u2019t handling the breakup well.On Thursday night, Fox News host Sean Hannity lamented how the media is covering the clash of the \u201ctwo titans\u201d and urged the men to reunite.xxYouTube Video\u201cThe rift between these two men, I\u2019ll be the first to say, it\u2019s sad, it\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Hannity said.xxYouTube VideoFox News host Laura Ingraham lamented that \u201cmegabillionaires\u201d can \u201cget their feelings hurt\u201d and counseled both men to reconcile their differences, sounding more like a marriage counselor than a political pundit.xxYouTube VideoMeanwhile, the hosts of Fox & Friends seemed to largely take Trump\u2019s side in the divorce. Co-host Brian Kilmeade compared Musk\u2019s comments to getting drunk and lashing out at a romantic partner.Democrats Point and LaughDemocrats could not contain their enjoyment at the very public feud.\u201cSo I heard Republicans are confused and waiting for Jerry Springer to tell them who their daddy is before any legislation can move! Is Elon their daddy or Trump?\u201d Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas asked.Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, noted, \u201cAnd some say women are too emotional for positions of leadership,\u201d followed by an eye-rolling emoji.Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico said, \u201cBreakups are hard, especially when they play out in the public sphere.\u201dAsked by reporters to react to the meltdown, New York Rep.

        "description":"The escalating feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump is adding to Tesla\u2019s challenges, which were already mounting. The stock\u2019s plunge on Thursday wiped out $152 billion in market cap, the most for any day in the company\u2019s 15-year history on the public market. Ire from the Trump administration could impact future regulation, investigations and government business with Tesla, or influence whether the company gets tariff exemptions.Tesla has been facing massive challenges trying to get back on track after a disastrous first quarter. Those headwinds strengthened considerably this week.CEO Elon Musk officially concluded his term with the Trump administration at the end of May, hitting the 130-day mark, the maximum time allowed for a \u201cspecial government employee.\u201d On his way out the door, Musk expressed sharp criticism of the Trump\u2019s signature spending bill that\u2019s being debated in Congress due to its expected impact on the national debt.What started off as a policy disagreement quickly escalated into an all-out online brawl, with Musk and President Donald Trump hurling insults at one other from their respective social media platforms. After Musk called the \u201cone, big beautiful bill\u201d an \u201cabomination\u201d and rallied his followers on X to \u201ckill the bill,\u201d Trump said Musk had gone \u201cCRAZY\u201d and threatened to end government contracts and cut off subsidies for Musk\u2019s companies. Musk responded, \u201cGo ahead, make my day.\u201dThe rift sent Tesla shares plummeting 14% on Thursday, wiping out roughly $152 billion in value, the most for any day in the company\u2019s 15 year-history on the public market. While Musk is still the richest person in the world on paper, his net worth plunged by $34 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index.More importantly, the spat brought about the collapse to a relationship that blended business, politics and power in a manner virtually unprecedented in U.S. history. The ramifications to Tesla, which fell out of the trillion-dollar club on Thursday, could be severe, and not just because Trump is reportedly considering selling or giving away the red Model S he purchased in March after turning the White House lawn into a Tesla showroom.A senior White House official told NBC News on Friday that the president was \u201cnot interested\u201d in having a call with Musk to resolve their feud.Ire from the Trump administration could influence everything from future regulation, investigations and government support for Tesla, to decisions on tariff exemptions the company has been seeking in order to purchase Chinese-made manufacturing equipment.Tesla shares were badly underperforming the broader market before the Musk-Trump breakup. Revenue slid 9% in the first quarter from a year earlier, with auto revenue plummeting 20%, due to the combination of increased competition from lower-cost EV makers in China and a consumer backlash to Trump\u2019s political activities and rhetoric.It\u2019s certainly not what Tesla shareholders were expecting, when they sent the stock up about 30% in the days following Trump\u2019s election victory in November. After spending close to $300 million to return Trump to the White House, Musk was poised to have a major role in the administration and be in position to push through regulatory changes in ways that benefited his companies.Instead, his company has suffered, and Musk\u2019s behavior is largely to blame.One of his most divisive actions in leading the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was the dismantling of USAID, which previously delivered billions of dollars of food and medicine to more than 100 countries.Beyond the U.S., Musk has endorsed Germany\u2019s far-right extremist party AfD, and gave a gesture that many viewed as a Nazi salute at an inauguration rally.In response, in recent months, there were numerous cases of vandalism or arson of Tesla facilities or vehicles in the U.S., as well as waves of peaceful protests at Tesla stores and service centers in North America and Europe.Advertisements in protest of Musk have appeared in New York\u2019s Times Square, and at bus shelters in London, urging people to boycott Tesla, some labeling the company\u2019s EVs as \u201cswasticars.\u201d The Vancouver International Auto Show even removed Tesla from its exhibitors\u2019 list fearing the company\u2019s presence would cause safety problems.On top of that are President Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, which have led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for EV production. In its first-quarter earnings report in April, Tesla refrained from promising growth this year and said it will \u201crevisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.\u201dBoard is mumPension funds that invest in Tesla have said the \u201ccrisis\u201d at the company requires a leader to work a minimum of 40 hours per week to focus on solving its problems.Public officials are echoing that sentiment, and calling on Tesla\u2019s board to take action.New York City Comptroller Brad Lander said on Thursday in a statement to CNBC that the \u201cschoolyard fight\u201d between Trump and Musk highlights how \u201cTesla\u2019s weak accountability measures and poor governance threaten not only the company\u2019s financial stability and shareholder value, but also the future of homegrown EV production.\u201dBrooke Lierman, comptroller of Maryland, told CNBC that the company\u2019s board \u201cis not doing its job to ensure that there is a CEO at Tesla who is putting the company\u2019s interests first.\u201dSince Musk\u2019s name is synonymous with Tesla, the board needs to ensure that Tesla can stand on its own regardless of who\u2019s leading the company, she added.\u201cMusk\u2019s behavior continues to threaten the future of Tesla,\u201d Lierman said. \u201cAs long as Tesla is identified with Elon Musk and he continues to be a polarizing figure, he will continue to damage the brand which is a huge part of Tesla\u2019s value.\u201dMusk didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. CNBC also reached out for comment to board chair Robyn Denholm and directors and executives who work in government relations and in the office of the CEO. None of them responded as of the time of publication.CNBCElon Musk interviews on CNBC from the Tesla Headquarters in Texas.Tesla investors focused on business fundamentals are justified in their skepticism.The company has failed to roll out innovative and affordable new model EVs, while Chinese competitors like BYD have flooded the market, particularly in Europe.Analysts at Goldman Sachs on Thursday lowered their price target on Tesla mostly due to the outlook for 2025. Deliveries this quarter are tracking lower for the U.S., the analysts noted, while European sales saw a 50% year-over-year decline in April and another double-digit drop in May. China sales from those two months were down about 20% from a year earlier.Quality is also a problem. Tesla has announced eight voluntary recalls of the Cybertruck in 15 months due to a range of issues including software bugs and sticking accelerator pedals.Robotaxi ready?Musk is urging investors to largely ignore the core business and look to the future, which he says is all about autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.But even there, Tesla is behind. In AVs the company has ceded ground to Alphabet\u2019s Waymo, which is operating commercial robotaxi services in several U.S. markets. After a decade of missed deadlines, Musk has promised a small launch of a Tesla driverless ride-hailing service in Austin this month.The Austin robotaxi service will operate in a geofenced area, Musk said in a recent interview with CNBC\u2019s David Faber, and will begin with a small fleet of just 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles with Full Self-Driving (FSD) Unsupervised technology installed. If all goes well, Musk has said, Tesla will try to rapidly expand its driverless offerings to other markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles.What consumers won\u2019t be seeing anytime soon are the Cybercab and Robovan vehicles that Tesla touted at its \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event last year to drum up customer and investor enthusiasm.On Friday, Milan Kovac, Tesla\u2019s vice president of Optimus robotics, announced he was leaving after joining the company in 2016. Musk thanked him for his \u201coutstanding contribution\u201d in a post on X.Still, there are plenty Tesla bulls and Musk fans who are believers in the CEO\u2019s vision. The stock\u2019s 4% rebound on Friday is a sign that some saw an opportunity to buy the dip.\u201cI think the real story here is the investor base of Tesla literally doesn\u2019t care about anything,\u201d Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and CNBC PRO contributor, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cHalftime Report\u201d Friday. \u201cThis is still a nothing matters stock.\u201dFundStrat\u2019s Tom Lee said the Tesla selloff was \u201coverdone.\u201dTesla\u2019s market cap, which is dramatically inflated relative to every other U.S. car maker, is built on Musk\u2019s vision of Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots doing factory work and babysitting our children, while self-driving Cybercabs and Robovans make money carting around passengers.Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas wrote in a note this week that, \u201cTesla still holds so many valuable cards that are largely apolitical,\u201d pointing to what he sees as the company\u2019s \u201cAI leadership, autonomy\/robotics, manufacturing, supply chain re-architecture, renewable power, [and] critical infrastructure.\u201dIn terms of Tesla\u2019s existing business, the most immediate impact from what\u2019s happening in Washington D.C., is the rollback of EV credits in the current budget bill that Musk loudly opposes and that\u2019s struggling to find sufficient support in the Senate. There\u2019s also the matter of the tariffs and whether Tesla is able to get preferred treatment, a proposition that seems increasingly unlikely with the Musk-Trump fallout.Matthew LaBrot, a former Tesla staff program manager, told CNBC that he\u2019s not surprised that Musk blew up his relationship with the president. LaBrot was terminated earlier this year after sending an open letter in protest of Musk\u2019s divisive political activity.\u201cI am devastated for the country and the climate, though Elon only has himself to blame,\u201d LaBrot said in an interview. \u201cBack a loose canon, expect stray canon fire.\u201dTesla investors can\u2019t know at the moment how much of Musk\u2019s energy and time will now return to his lone public company, and the business responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Even without politics, he still has SpaceX, AI startup xAI and brain tech startup Neuralink, among other businesses.As of Thursday, Musk still had a West Wing office that hadn\u2019t been cleaned out, two administration officials told NBC News. The space will likely be packed up in the coming days, one of the officials said.And while his time in the Trump camp may be over, Musk has called on his followers to form a new party in the U.S.\u201cIs it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?\u201d he wrote on X on Thursday, in a post that\u2019s now pinned at the top of his page. According to the post, 80% of 5.6 million respondents to the unofficial poll said \u201cyes.\u201dMusk\u2019s actions this week may have caused a permanent rift with the president. But one thing is clear \u2014 his company can\u2019t get away from the White House.WATCH: Impact of Musk\u2019s feud with Trump",

        "title":"Tesla gets caught in the crossfire of Musk and Trump\u2019s ugly divorce",
        "description":"President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk are on the rocks, and neither one is coming out of it looking good.Since stepping down from his role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has been waging a war on Trump\u2019s budget, making it harder for him to get his prized piece of legislation passed. But Trump\u2019s public swipe\u2014saying he\u2019s \u201cvery disappointed with Elon\u201d\u2014has had an immediate consequence for the billionaire: He\u2019s losing money. Tesla shares dropped by more than 14% after their spat began on Thursday, erasing part of a 22% rally in May despite sluggish sales.It\u2019s more bad news for Tesla, which is limping out of a rough quarter marked by slumping sales in California, China, and Europe, even as the overall electric vehicle market grows. Revenue is falling, Trump\u2019s tariffs are raising investor anxiety, and Musk\u2019s semi-sabbatical to run DOGE certainly didn\u2019t help. While he was busy slashing federal jobs and gutting public programs, Tesla was losing market share, investor confidence, and\u2014judging by recent protests\u2014public goodwill.And now that the bromance is over, there may be a price to pay for publicly defying Trump. According to CNBC, Tesla shares have dropped at least 12% this week as Musk continues to bash Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big, Beautiful Bill Act.\u201d For the year, stock is down by more than 20% and well off its December 18 peak of $488.54.A protester holds a sign that reads, \u201cDon\u2019t buy swasticars\u201d outside of a Tesla vehicle dealership in Georgia.Musk is quickly finding out that you\u2019re damned if you go against Trump, and you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t.The fallout began after Musk denounced Trump\u2019s budget bill\u2014a wildly unpopular package that would slash food assistance, strip health insurance from millions, and risk tanking the U.S. economy\u2014all to give tax cuts to the wealthy.Trump claims that Musk\u2019s opposition is personal, blaming it on the bill\u2019s elimination of EV tax credits and his decision to block Musk\u2019s pick to lead NASA, Jared Isaacman, who was awaiting Senate confirmation.But Musk fired back on X.\u201cWhatever. Keep the EV\/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful,\u201d he posted. He also claimed that, without his help, Trump would have lost the 2024 presidential election\u201cDems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d wrote Musk, who poured more than $250 million into Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, making him the biggest financial backer.As the back-and-forth dragged on, things only got frostier. Trump threatened to strip Musk of government contracts and subsidies as part of his budget cuts. Musk, in turn, made a thinly veiled threat that he\u2019ll be around to cause headaches far longer than Trump will be. He also claimed, without evidence, that Trump is named in \u201cthe Epstein files,\u201d alleging that that\u2019s \u201cthe real reason they have not been made public.\u201dBefore this, Musk threatened to help primary challengers against Republicans who voted for the bill, which he called a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d\u2014a sharp shift in tone from Trump\u2019s onetime \u201cfirst buddy\u201d and agenda financier.Will Musk back off now that his quarrel with Trump is hitting his wallet? Who knows. But this fight is juicy, and no one\u2019s walking away clean.Campaign Action",

        "description":"President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are in the middle of a spectacular and tawdry breakup that has the world riveted.Here\u2019s a history of their rise and fall as best buds.Don and Elon: The Union BeginsThe Trump-Musk coupling began in earnest in July 2024, about four months before that year\u2019s presidential election. On July 13, minutes after an attempted assassination on Trump, Musk stopped dancing around his yearslong march to the MAGA right and officially endorsed Trump\u2019s campaign.The shotgun wedding happened at lightning speed, as Musk began throwing out millions of dollars to back Trump and sent millions more to his political action committee and other more underhanded vehicles to support Trump in the election.Musk could not contain his joy at joining the MAGA movement and even bounced across the stage at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, launching thousands of mocking memes.xxYouTube VideoThe DOGE HoneymoonAfter Trump won the election, both men were over the moon and wanted everyone to know about it. Trump quickly announced that Musk would get to head his Department of Government Efficiency and would effectively be allowed to do whatever he wanted, without any real oversight or ethics constraints.In January, Musk attracted an early round of criticism when he offered up a Nazi salute at ceremonies commemorating Trump\u2019s first day in office. That foreshadowed the months of chaos he and Trump would soon find themselves enmeshed in.Still, Trump began fulfilling his part of the deal and pulled back government resources investigating Musk\u2019s constellation of businesses.Elon Musk throws up a Nazi salute at an indoor presidential Inauguration event in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20.Musk vs. Trump: First Shots FiredCracks began to emerge in the bromance around the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Both men have long track records of wanting to be seen as the so-called alpha male, the guy in charge of things. But as Trump began to allow Musk and DOGE to do as they wished with an array of federal agencies, the president\u2019s team bristled at reporting and rumors that hinted that Musk was really in charge or was something of a co-president.From the outside, Americans were now making it clear they didn\u2019t like the direction in which Trump and Musk were attempting to take the country. In February, one prankster broke into the video system at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and broadcast an AI-generated video of Trump sucking on Musk\u2019s toes, with superimposed text reading, \u201cLONG LIVE THE REAL KING.\u201dEarly polling started to show that Musk was a liability for Trump. As Trump\u2019s second try at the presidency kicked off, his \u201cfirst buddy\u201d already had underwater approval ratings. Trump would soon join him there.Musk and Trump Hold Hands Against the WorldThe two men continued to put up a brave, joint front despite the slings and arrows directed their way. As Musk danced onstage with a chainsaw at a conservative conference in February to demonstrate his support of Trump and hatred for government services, Trump was rewarding Musk\u2019s companies for their boss\u2019 loyalty.Starlink, Musk\u2019s satellite internet company, was suddenly in the running for billions in government contracts, further entwining Musk\u2019s considerable fortune with taxpayer dollars\u2014even as he claimed he was cutting wasteful spending.President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to reporters near a Tesla vehicle on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11.There was a bit of an awkward moment at Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress in March. The president slammed \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d in Washington ... as Musk looked on admiringly from the audience as Trump\u2019s invited guest to the event.While pushing DOGE to destabilize the government, Musk continued to make pro-Trump gestures. His America PAC spent $1 million on ads praising Trump for doing a great job. It\u2019s like a bouquet of roses, just much more expensive.Toward the end of February, Musk got to sit in on Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting. After protests against DOGE began to crush Tesla\u2019s stock price, Trump staged a sales pitch for Tesla in front of the White House.Musk and Trump Hit a Rough PatchThen things went sour, and they went sour quickly.In early March, Musk reportedly had a fight with Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a White House meeting, and complained that Rubio hadn\u2019t fired enough people. Rubio also apparently didn\u2019t like that, via DOGE, Musk had fired officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development, which handles most of the government\u2019s foreign aid and is under the State Department\u2019s jurisdiction.Musk\u2019s actions at USAID also generated bad headlines for Trump after it was determined that key aid, food, and medicine was being denied to desperate people across the world.Musk, riding high after his millions helped Trump win an election, appeared to believe he had a magic touch, so he spent over $20 million to elect the conservative candidate for Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court seat. However, Democrats successfully pointed out the role of the unpopular billionaire interfering in state business, and in April, liberal candidate Susan Crawford easily won.President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30.After that public face-plant, reports emerged that Trump was seeking an exit for Musk. The widely reported loss in Wisconsin clearly ran counter to the image Trump has tried to build up for himself as a winner.Awkward.Knives OutIn April, Musk said White House trade advisor Peter Navarro was a \u201cmoron\u201d after Navarro slammed Musk for criticizing Trump\u2019s failing tariff policy. That same month, Trump reportedly banned Musk from attending a meeting at the Pentagon on China policy. According to an official quoted by Axios, Trump said, \u201cWhat the fuck is Elon doing there? Make sure he doesn\u2019t go.\u201dMusk benefitted immensely from Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, getting government oversight off his back and inserting his influence into the federal government. But the writing was on the wall.Last Friday, Trump ceremonially handed Musk a golden key, and the two men declared that Musk\u2019s time in government was over (even as DOGE continues to wreak havoc).This was around the time Musk first announced his opposition to Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d complaining that it doesn\u2019t hurt the middle-class and poor people enough. And he only ramped it up after that.War\u201cLook, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don\u2019t know if we will anymore,\u201d Trump said on Thursday as the breakup went global.On the same day, Musk said Trump lied about showing him the legislation before it went to Congress. Then he accused Trump\u2019s administration of covering up government files around convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein because Trump appeared in them. Musk also argued that Trump would have lost the election without his financial help.Caught in the crossfire were figures like Vice President JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who have tied themselves to Trump\u2019s political fortunes but want the millions that Musk can provide as well as the pro-Republican messages that are amplified on X, formerly Twitter.Fox News, Trump\u2019s eternal cheerleader, isn\u2019t handling the breakup well.On Thursday night, Fox News host Sean Hannity lamented how the media is covering the clash of the \u201ctwo titans\u201d and urged the men to reunite.xxYouTube Video\u201cThe rift between these two men, I\u2019ll be the first to say, it\u2019s sad, it\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Hannity said.xxYouTube VideoFox News host Laura Ingraham lamented that \u201cmegabillionaires\u201d can \u201cget their feelings hurt\u201d and counseled both men to reconcile their differences, sounding more like a marriage counselor than a political pundit.xxYouTube VideoMeanwhile, the hosts of Fox & Friends seemed to largely take Trump\u2019s side in the divorce. Co-host Brian Kilmeade compared Musk\u2019s comments to getting drunk and lashing out at a romantic partner.Democrats Point and LaughDemocrats could not contain their enjoyment at the very public feud.\u201cSo I heard Republicans are confused and waiting for Jerry Springer to tell them who their daddy is before any legislation can move! Is Elon their daddy or Trump?\u201d Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas asked.Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, noted, \u201cAnd some say women are too emotional for positions of leadership,\u201d followed by an eye-rolling emoji.Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico said, \u201cBreakups are hard, especially when they play out in the public sphere.\u201dAsked by reporters to react to the meltdown, New York Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez replied, \u201cThe girls are fighting, aren\u2019t they?\u201dThey sure are.xAOC: The girls are fighting aren\u2019t they\u2014 Acyn (@acyn.bsky.social) 2025-06-05T23:57:21.442ZCampaign Action",

Never been better!At least, that's what he called multiple reporters on Thursday and Friday to insist upon, as Americans point and laugh that Trump\u2019s sugar daddy is now trashing Trump\u2019s signature piece of legislation, drawing attention to Trump\u2019s ties to noted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and even calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment.Trump told CNN's Dana Bash in a phone conversation that he's \"not even thinking about\" Musk and that he won't be speaking to his now former First Buddy anytime soon.Related | How Trump and Musk went from best friends to frenemies to nuclear warBash recounted her conversation with the scorned commander in chief: \u201cHe said, \u2018He\u2019s got a problem. The poor guy\u2019s got a problem.\u2019 I said, \u2018So no call with Elon now?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, I won\u2019t be speaking to him for a while, I guess, but I wish him well.\u2019\u201dTrump also called CBS News correspondent Robert Costa to say he's \"totally\" focused on his presidency and not at all focused on Musk. \"I don't focus on anything else,\" Trump told Costa of his presidency.He told Politico's Dasha Burns that his public breakup with Musk is \"okay,\" and that his presidency is \u201cgoing very well, never done better.\u201dIn a call with the New York Post\u2014which poked fun at Trump\u2019s break-up with Musk on the tabloid\u2019s front page\u2014Trump said he wasn\u2019t surprised about the fact that his friendship with Musk went south.\u201cNothing catches me by surprise. Nothing,\u201d Trump told the Post, adding that everything is awesome! \u201cThe numbers are through the roof, the stock market is up, billions are pouring in from tariffs, and my poll numbers are the highest they\u2019ve ever been. Other than that, what can I tell you, right?\u201d Trump said.But Trump got a little fiestier with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, telling him that Musk is \u201cthe man who has lost his mind\" and that he's \u201cnot particularly\" interested in speaking to Musk, even though Musk wants to talk.It\u2019s as if he\u2019s going through the five stages of grief in real time. Denial (insisting that he\u2019s not mad Musk is trashing him), and anger (insulting Musk as having lost his mind) are up first. We\u2019ll see when he gets to bargaining, depression, and later, acceptance.But it\u2019s safe to say, if Trump is speaking to reporters to insist that he's fine and not thinking about Musk, he is absolutely thinking about Musk\u2014who could use his immense wealth to go after Republicans in the 2026 midterms.Ultimately right now, Trump is the living embodiment of the infamous Dril tweet :Campaign Action",

        "description":"Rep. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) is coming under fire from colleagues in both parties after misidentifying a Sikh man as Muslim and saying he should have \"never been allowed\" to deliver the House's morning prayer.Why it matters: Even some Republicans are expressing disgust at Miller, a right-wing hardliner who has cultivated a reputation for making inflammatory comments.\"People should think before they talk or type,\" vented one House Republican, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer candid thoughts on a fellow Republican.Miller's office has not responded to a request for comment on her post.What happened: After Giani Singh, a Sikh Grandhi from Southern New Jersey, delivered the House of Representatives' daily prayer, Miller said in a now-deleted post on X that it was \"deeply troubling a Muslim was allowed to lead prayer in the House of Representatives this morning.\"\"This should have never been allowed to happen,\" she said, erroneously stating that the U.S. was \"founded as a Christian nation\" and that \"our government should reflect that truth.\"Miller later edited the post to replace \"Muslim\" with \"Sikh,\" then deleted it altogether.What they're saying: The House Republican who spoke to Axios said Miller's comments make her look \"darn ignorant.\"Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) said in a post on X that \"a Sikh prayer on the House floor ... doesn't violate the Constitution, offend my Catholic faith, or throttle my support for Israel,\" adding, \"Live and let live.\"\"I'm deeply disappointed by Rep.

He said, 'Whoever has the youth has the future.'\" She later apologized for the remark.She also said that Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022 was a \"victory for white life,\" which her office later claimed was a misread of her prepared remarks.",
